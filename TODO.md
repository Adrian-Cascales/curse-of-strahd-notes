- Get familiar with [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]]'s character sheet (they'll probably fight him some)
- prep the Vallaki is burning thing
- find stat blocks for vampire spawn
	- how many are there?
- [[Elora]] will get an opportunity attack on the spawn as he runs away
- Everyone can roll initiative (besides garrett) for their own fights at the start


- if not kidnapped:
	- [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] should get some unwelcome presents from [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]]
		- maybe sometime after the battle if she's not kidnapped
		- she'll respond by getting pissed or crying
	- [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] should help out with money to buy something nice for the party, or some other non-combat help
