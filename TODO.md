[]()Ireena options:
- The party comes across a grave somewhere meaningful. Strahd has buried her
- Strahd is able to bring her back?


- Read up on the dark powers; that will probably play into what [[Pelanil]] experiences after dying
- Can [[The Abbott]] actually bring people back to life?!
	- yes he can
	- So, maybe [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] takes [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] there to be revived [[The Abbott]] asks [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] to leave her so that he can "give [Strahd] his heart's desire"
		- he actually uses her corpse to add pieces to [[Vasilka]]
		- and this will piss strahd off when he finds out
	- Or [[The Abbott]] reincarnated [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] into [[Vasilka]]'s shell
