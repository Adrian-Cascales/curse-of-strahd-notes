- Pick a dark power for [[Pelanil]]
	- The dark power is trying to replace [[Vampyr]]'s champion, [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]], with [[Pelanil]]
	- [[Pelanil]] already had the conversation with the dark power, but forgot it
		- write a note to send only to Christian that says his new goal is to replace [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]]
		- he agreed to this in return for his life
		- the dark power is his new deity
		- he's giving him boons so that he looks like he is a servant of [[Vampyr]] to [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]]
			- but that's just a trick for [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]]
		- [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] thought he asked [[Vampyr]] for help at the [[The Amber Temple (X)|Amber Temple]], but he actually ended up talking to this dark power
		- [[Vampyr]] feeds off the souls who died of extreme blood loss
			- the new dark power needs to feed off the souls of something pelanil did
				- betrayed him
				- or fear
- Write the original conversation between [[Pelanil]] and the dark power
- Give [[Pelanil]] a new boon for killing [[Gadof Blinsky|Blinsky]]
	- the dark power can tell him he earned it


- Get a description of the dark power that [[Pelanil]] sees in the mist
	- he couldn't remember it the last time, but with his truesight, he can see it clearly this time while it's pulling him into the mist


- decide what [[Shalooti]]'s 15 strength save does when pulling on [[Elora]]
- The killed revenant will show back up somewhere else unless the beacon is lit
	- grave in [[Village of Krezk (S)|Krezk]]
	- grave in [[Ruins of Berez (U)|Berez]]
	- random encounter
	- corpse of deceased player

- place the third missing gem somewhere

- Tell the group that the second gem is in [[Ruins of Berez (U)|Berez]]
- [[Ezmerelda d'Avenir|Ezmerelda]] and [[Rictavio|van Richten]]
	- maybe run the [[Ezmerelda d'Avenir|Ezmerelda]] event when they take the skull back to [[Argynvostholt (Q)|Argynvostholt]]

Ireena options:
- The party comes across a grave somewhere meaningful. Strahd has buried her
	- [[The Abbott]] refused to revive her, so [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] buried her
- Strahd is able to bring her back via [[The Abbott]]
	- [[The Abbott]] convinced [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] to leave her corpse so that he could (unbeknownst to [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]]) sew her into [[Vasilka]]
- Can [[The Abbott]] actually bring people back to life?!
	- yes he can
	- So, maybe [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] takes [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] there to be revived [[The Abbott]] asks [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] to leave her so that he can "give [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] his heart's desire"
		- he actually uses her corpse to add pieces to [[Vasilka]]
		- and this will piss strahd off when he finds out
	- Or [[The Abbott]] reincarnated [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] into [[Vasilka]]'s shell

- Read up on the dark powers; that will probably play into what [[Pelanil]] experiences after dying
- Give [[Pelanil]] a dream from the [Dark Power](https://www.reddit.com/r/CurseofStrahd/comments/9zswmf/fleshing_out_curse_of_strahd_running_the_dark/) that gives him extra strength to help with damage
	- and let him know that he has a connection with a new powerful being (this can be his new deity)

Decision for Ireena:
- [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] took her to [[The Abbott]] to be revived
- [[The Abbott]] tried, but the spell wouldn't work correctly ([[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]]'s curse of never being with [[Tatyana]] stopped it from working)
- They buried her outside the church
- After [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] left, [[The Abbott]] dug her up and cut off her scalp and hair to add to [[Vasilka]]
	- he hopes that he can re-incarnate [[Tatyana]] into this body to present to [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] for a wedding
