Ireena options:
- The party comes across a grave somewhere meaningful. Strahd has buried her
	- [[The Abbott]] refused to revive her, so [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] buried her
- Strahd is able to bring her back via [[The Abbott]]
	- [[The Abbott]] convinced [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] to leave her corpse so that he could (unbeknowst to [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]]) sew her into [[Vasilka]]
- Can [[The Abbott]] actually bring people back to life?!
	- yes he can
	- So, maybe [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] takes [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] there to be revived [[The Abbott]] asks [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] to leave her so that he can "give [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] his heart's desire"
		- he actually uses her corpse to add pieces to [[Vasilka]]
		- and this will piss strahd off when he finds out
	- Or [[The Abbott]] reincarnated [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] into [[Vasilka]]'s shell

- Read up on the dark powers; that will probably play into what [[Pelanil]] experiences after dying
- Give [[Pelanil]] a dream from the [Dark Power](https://www.reddit.com/r/CurseofStrahd/comments/9zswmf/fleshing_out_curse_of_strahd_running_the_dark/) that gives him extra strength to help with damage
	- and let him know that he has a connection with a new powerful being (this can be his new deity)

Decision for Ireena:
- [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] took her to [[The Abbott]] to be revived
- [[The Abbott]] tried, but the spell wouldn't work correctly ([[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]]'s curse of never being with [[Tatyana]] stopped it from working)
- They buried her outside the church
- After [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] left, [[The Abbott]] dug her up and cut off her scalp and hair to add to [[Vasilka]]
	- he hopes that he can re-incarnate [[Tatyana]] into this body to present to [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] for a wedding
