What is Strahd's motivation?

##### assistant
Strahd von Zarovich, the primary antagonist in the classic Dungeons & Dragons adventure "Ravenloft: The Curse of Strahd," is a complex character with a rich backstory. His motivations are rooted in a combination of love, revenge, and supernatural powers.
According to the lore, Strahd was once a nobleman named Vlad Tepes (also known as Vlad the Impaler), who lived in Wallachia during the late 15th century. He was known for his cruelty and sadism, particularly his fondness for impaling his enemies. Strahd fell in love with a beautiful woman named Maria, but she was betrayed and killed by his brother. Driven mad with grief and anger, Strahd made a pact with a demon, selling his soul for the power to bring Maria back to life.
However, when Maria returned, she was transformed into a vampire and became Strahd's undead bride. Strahd has been cursed to exist as a vampire, unable to find peace and tormented by his grief and love for Maria. He seeks to find a way to break the curse and be reunited with her, often targeting potential lovers in the lands of Barovia.
Strahd's motivations can also be influenced by the actions of adventurers who enter his domain. Depending on the choices they make, Strahd may become more or less interested in pursuing them, either as a way to distract himself from his grief or as a means of manipulating them to further his own ends. Overall, Strahd's motivation is driven by his deep-seated grief and love for Maria, as well as his desire for power and control.

Based on my notes, what are strahd's motivations

##### assistant
Strahd's primary motivation is motivated by a deep sense of anger and a desire to inflict suffering on others, driven by his own experiences of loss and betrayal. He seeks to punish those who enter his domain and tries to eliminate any threats to his power as the vampire lord of Barovia. Strahd's past includes being betrayed by his brother and losing his beloved Tatyana to him. He also yearns to find a way to break the curse that keeps him trapped as a vampire and to be reunited with his mother and sister. He is known to have a special connection to the character Ireena Kolyana due to her resemblance to Tatyana, and his motivation towards her includes both fascination and a desire to turn her into his vampire consort. Additionally, Strahd is also drawn to those with great potential and may manipulate them to serve his own purposes.
