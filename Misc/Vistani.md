## Vistani Lore
### [[Strahd Von Zarovich]]
- Strahd comes from a royal bloodline
	- He died centuries ago yet endures as one of the undead, feasting on the blood of the living
	- Barovians refer to him as "the devil Strahd"
- Strahd has taken many consorts, but he has known only one true love: a Barovian peasant girl named [[Tatyana]]. ( the Vistani don't know what happened to her)
- Strahd named the castle, [[Castle Ravenloft|Ravenloft]], after his beloved mother, [[Queen Ravenovia]]
	- Strangers aren't welcomed at the castle without an invite
 
### The Land of Barovia
- Strahd conquered this land centuries ago and named it after his father [[King Barov]]
	- Strahd uses wolves, bats, and other creatures to spy on all of his realm
- Barovians are simple, frightened people
	- Some have old souls, but many do not
	- The soulless ones are easy to spot, for they know nothing but fear
	- They have no charm, hope, or spark, and they don't cry
 - The [[Old Svalich Road]] passes through Strahd's domain
	 - Three settlements lie on the road like beads on a string
		 - [[Krezk]] to the west
		 - [[Vallaki]] in the heart of the valley
		 - [[Village of Barovia|Barovia]] to the east
		 - Strahd has spies in each settlement
- There's an old windmill ([[Old Bonegrinder]]) on the road between the [[Village of Barovia]] and  the town of [[Vallaki]]
	- It should be avoided at all costs! (They refuse to say more)
- It is wise to stick to the road
	- Wild druids, wayward ghosts, and packs of wolves and werewolves haunt the [[Svalich Woods]]

### Beliefs and Superstitions
- The souls of those who die in Barovia can't escape to the afterlife
	- They are prisoners of Strahd's domain
- Some Vistani women are blessed with prescience
	- Of all the great Vistani fortune-tellers, none compares to [[Madam Eva]]
	- If knowledge of the future is what you seek, [[Madam Eva]] will tell you your fate
- A prescient Vistana can't see her own future or the future of another Vistana
	- It is the burden of the Vistani's great gift that their own fates can't be divined
- Vistani curses are potent, but they are invoked with great caution
- Vistani know that to curse one who is undeserving of such punishment can have grave consequences for the one who utters such a curse
- Ravens carry lost souls within them, so killing one is bad luck. (The ravens don't carry lost sols within)
