1. Make a brand new character and introduce them to the campaign in the usual way
2. Let them use their same character sheet under a different name
	- {maybe their soul was transferred like others in Barovia}
	- Give them some sort of flaw
3. Let them play an NPC
	- [[Ireena Kolyana]] will follow the group for a long time
