## [[Strahd Von Zarovich]]
- Strahd comes from a royal bloodline. He died centuries ago yet endures as one of the undead, feasting on the blood of the living. Barovians refer to him as “the devil Strahd.”
- Strahd has taken many consorts, but he has known only one true love: a Barovian peasant girl  
named [[Tatyana. (The Vistani don’t know what happened to her.)
- Strahd named his castle, Ravenloft, after his beloved mother, Queen Ravenovia. Strangers aren’t welcome at the castle without an invitation.
