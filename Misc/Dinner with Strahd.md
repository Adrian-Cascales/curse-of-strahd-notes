## Arrival
- [[Cyrus Belview]] is dressed for the occasion
	- his clothes are washed, his hair is sort of tamed with a very pungent grease
	- he bows low and motions the party inside
	- he leads them to K8 where [[Rahadin]] is waiting

- If the players are not dressed for a fancy dinner, [[Rahadin]] chastises them and leads them upstairs to the guest quarters (K50) to change
	- [[Escher]] and [[Gertruda]] are there laying out suitable outfits for the players
	- they're somehow appropriately sized; how did [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] get those measurements?

- [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] is not an illusion, he can either be playing the organ when they enter or sitting at the table
- There are others at the dinner either as guests or as wait staff:
	- [[Cyrus Belview|Cyrus]] is actually an accomplished cook and head chef
		- he cooks every meal
	- There is a maid acting as a waitress [[Helga]]
		- doesn't make eye contact or say a word
	- Strahd's consorts also come to dinner
		- [[Escher]]
		- [[Ludmilla Villisevic]]
		- [[Anastrasya Karelova]]
		- [[Volenta Popofsky]]
		- maybe [[Gertruda]]
