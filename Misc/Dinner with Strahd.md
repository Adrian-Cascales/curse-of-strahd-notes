## Arrival
- [[Cyrus Belview]] is dressed for the occasion
	- his clothes are washed, his hair is sort of tamed with a very pungent grease
	- he bows low and motions the party inside
	- he leads them to K8 where [[Rahadin]] is waiting

- If the players are not dressed for a fancy dinner, [[Rahadin]] chastises them and leads them upstairs to the guest quarters (K50) to change
	- [[Escher]] and [[Gertruda]] are there laying out suitable outfits for the players
	- they're somehow appropriately sized; how did [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] get those measurements?

## Dinner
- [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] is not an illusion, he can either be playing the organ when they enter or sitting at the table
- There are others at the dinner either as guests or as wait staff:
	- [[Cyrus Belview|Cyrus]] is actually an accomplished cook and head chef
		- he cooks every meal
	- There is a maid acting as a waitress [[Helga]]
		- doesn't make eye contact or say a word
	- Strahd's consorts also come to dinner
		- [[Escher]]
		- [[Ludmilla Villisevic]]
		- [[Anastrasya Karelova]]
		- [[Volenta Popofsky]]
		- maybe [[Gertruda]]
- Make dinner a nice fancy multi-course dinner; maybe even cook for the players
	- [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] sends the [[Vistani]] in search of rare foods
- [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] and the vampire spawns do not eat
	- they just sit there drinking goblets of what is probably blood

### Flow of Dinner
#### Starter
- a bowl of lobster bisque is set in front of each player
- [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] makes a formal introduction, introduces the consorts, talks about how he came to live in this land, and asks each player about their backstory in turn

>Welcome, my friends. I fear that we have yet to have formal introductions. I am Count Strahd von Zarovich, Lord of Barovia, Master of Castle Ravenloft. Tonight, you are my guests, and no harm shall befall you while you remain in my home. I am a man of my word, and you have it.
>These are my three brides, Ludmilla Villisevic, Anastrasya Karelova, Volenta Popofsky, and I believe you have already met my consort Escher.
>
>As you eat, let me share with you a brief history of these lands and of this Castle.
>
>After the death of my father, King Barov, I waged a long war, finally killing the last of my family's enemies, liberating the people in this very valley. I decided to settle here, and thus named the land Barovia after my late father.
>
>I scoured my newly conquered lands for wizards and artisans, brought them to the valley of Barovia, and commanded them to raise a castle to rival the magnificent fortresses of my ancestral homeland.
>
>Once Castle Ravenloft was completed, I invited its namesake, my mother, Queen Ravenovia, to join me here. Alas, mother did not survive the journey, but her spirit lives on in this castle.
>
>Now, please tell me more about each of yourselves. Your homelands, your story, your lives.

- Ask each player to explain their backstories

#### Main Course
- the bowl of lobster bisque is cleared away and replaced by a plate of sliced tender beef framed by vibrant greens
	- for [[Shalooti]] and [[Bardolf]] salmon on a cedar plank
- In between each character is placed a bowl of freshly baked bread and a pad of freshly churned butter

- Strahd discusses his goals (TODO:)
- At this point, there can be a bunch of side conversations
>

#### Dessert
- Saucers of fresh fruit are brought forth
	- the vibrant colors of the fruit, picked at the height of their season contrast with the dark shadows of the castle

>Surely now, you must have some questions for me. Please, I'm all ears

[[Strahd's Answers to Questions]]

- If tensions are high, [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] tries to smooth things over with a joke:
>Castle Ravenloft has an extensive library. Just the other day, I was reading a book about an immortal dog. It was impossible to put down

- Strahd has prepared a [[Wall of Force]] spell to deal with attacks from players and block himself and his consorts
- He tries to get things back on track
	- worst case, he and the consorts disappear for the hall in mist form
		- all lights go out
		- Strahd's guarantee of protection goes away

>I assure you this wall is for your protection. You're trying to skip to the end of the story, but there are so many pages to go.

- Sow distrust

>One of you will betray the others. Which one will it be?


## After Dinner
- [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] invites them to stay the night
	- says they should feel free to explore the castle, but only the upper levels
- They're escorted back to their rooms by [[Cyrus Belview|Cyrus]]
- They have protection unless they get into shit
	- Going downstairs makes [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] mad
		- especially into [[Sergei]]'s crypt
	- None of the traps upstairs are set
		- but if they try to unlock locked doors, there may be trouble

## Morning
- In the morning, [[Cyrus Belview|Cyrus]] escorts them back to the carriage and says that it will take them to anywhere in Barovia
	- once they arrive there, the doors slam shut, and it bolts back towards [[Castle Ravenloft (K)|Castle Ravenloft]]
	- Consider throwing a bunch of vampire spawn and dire wolves at them once they arrive
		- [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] still wants them dead
