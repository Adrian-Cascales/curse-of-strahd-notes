## Arrival
- [[Cyrus Belview]] is dressed for the occasion
	- his clothes are washed, his hair is sort of tamed with a very pungent grease
	- he bows low and motions the party inside
	- he leads them to K8 where [[Rahadin]] is waiting

- If the players are not dressed for a fancy dinner, [[Rahadin]] chastises them and leads them upstairs to the guest quarters (K50) to change
	- [[Escher]] and [[Gertruda]] are there laying out suitable outfits for the players
	- they're somehow appropriately sized; how did [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] get those measurements?


- Sow distrust
