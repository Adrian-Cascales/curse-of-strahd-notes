## Approaching
Read this as the party passes the path that branches toward the windmill

>The Old Svalich Road transitions here from being a winding path through the Balinok Mountains to a lazy trail that hugs the mountainside as it descends into a fog-filled valley. In the heart of the valley you see a walled town near the shores of a great mountain lake, its waters dark and still. A branch in the road leads west to a promontory, atop which is perched a dilapidated stone windmill, its warped wooden vanes stripped bare.

Closer investigation:
>The onion-domed edifice leans forward and to one side, like a crippled old woman just trying to get by. You see gray brick walls and dirt-covered windows on the upper floors. A decrepit wooden platform encircles the windmill above a flimsy doorway leading to the building's interior. Perched on a wooden beam above the door is a raven. It hops about and squawks at you, seemingly agitated.

- DC 12 Insight -> senses the raven is trying to warn the party
	- After delivering the message, the raven flies off toward the valley below ([[The Town of Vallaki (N)]])

- Beyond the windmill is the forest
	- Once atop the windmill's hill, the characters can see a ring of four squat megaliths at the forest's edge
	- Ravens can be seen circling in the air above the stones (see [[#The Megaliths]])

## Interactions
- [[Morgantha]] is not home when the characters arrive, but her daughters [[Bella Sunbane]] and [[Offalia Wormwiggle]] are there. [[Bella Sunbane|Bella]] is 

## Areas
### Ground Floor
>The ground floor has been converted into a makeshift kitchen, but the room is a bit disorganized and has a musty, lived-in air about it. Baskets and old dishware are piled in one corner. Adding to the clutter is a peddler's cart, a chicken coop, a heavy wooden trunk, and a pretty wooden cabinet with flowers painted on its doors.
>
>There is an open, upright barrel in the center of the room.
>
>A large brick oven takes up most of one side of the room. The oven emits warmth and you can smell something sweet baking inside. Surrounding the oven on some shelves are several jars of condiments and ingredients. There's also a couple rubbish bins filled with animal bones and bits of discarded dough

If inspecting the barrel:
>As you look into the barrel, the sweet smell of pastries blends horridly with a stench that burns your nostrils.

- The barrel holds glistening, greenish-black demon ichor

- Anyone still addicted knows the smell of the dream pastries right away and gets a craving
	- If anyone looks in the oven, they also recognize them as [[Mechanics of Dream Pastries]]

Inside the cabinet:
>Wooden bowls full of herbs and baking ingredients, including flour, sugar, and several gourds of powdered bone. Hanging on the inside of the cabinet doors are a dozen locks of hair. Amid various concoctions are three small, labeled containers that hold elixirs. The first elixir, labeled "Youth," is a golden syrup that magically makes the imbiber appear younger and more attractive for 24 hours. The second elixir, labeled "Laughter," is a nonmagical red tea that infects the imbiber with cackle fever (see "Diseases" in chapter 8, "Running the Game," of the [Dungeon Master's Guide](http://longo.com.br/5e/book.html#dmg)). The third elixir, a greenish milky liquid labeled "Mother's Milk," is actually a dose of pale tincture (see "Poisons" in chapter 8 of the [Dungeon Master's Guide](http://longo.com.br/5e/book.html#dmg)).
