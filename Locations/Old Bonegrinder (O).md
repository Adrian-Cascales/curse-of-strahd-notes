## Approaching
Read this as the party passes the path that branches toward the windmill

>The Old Svalich Road transitions here from being a winding path through the Balinok Mountains to a lazy trail that hugs the mountainside as it descends into a fog-filled valley. In the heart of the valley you see a walled town near the shores of a great mountain lake, its waters dark and still. A branch in the road leads west to a promontory, atop which is perched a dilapidated stone windmill, its warped wooden vanes stripped bare.

Closer investigation:
>The onion-domed edifice leans forward and to one side, as though trying to turn away from the stormy gray sky. You see gray brick walls and dirt-covered windows on the upper floors. A decrepit wooden platform encircles the windmill above a flimsy doorway leading to the building's interior. Perched on a wooden beam above the door is a raven. It hops about and squawks at you, seemingly agitated.

- DC 12 Insight -> senses the raven is trying to warn the party
	- After delivering the message, the raven flies off toward the valley below ([[The Town of Vallaki (N)]])

- Beyond the windmill is the forest
	- Once atop the windmill's hill, the characters can see a ring of four squat megaliths at the forest's edge
	- Ravens can be seen circling in the air above the stones (see [[#The Megaliths]])
