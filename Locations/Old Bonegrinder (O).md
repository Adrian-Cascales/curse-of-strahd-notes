## Approaching
Read this as the party passes the path that branches toward the windmill

>The Old Svalich Road transitions here from being a winding path through the Balinok Mountains to a lazy trail that hugs the mountainside as it descends into a fog-filled valley. In the heart of the valley you see a walled town near the shores of a great mountain lake, its waters dark and still. A branch in the road leads west to a promontory, atop which is perched a dilapidated stone windmill, its warped wooden vanes stripped bare.

Closer investigation:
>The onion-domed edifice leans forward and to one side,Â like a crippled old woman just trying to get by. You see gray brick walls and dirt-covered windows on the upper floors. A decrepit wooden platform encircles the windmill above a flimsy doorway leading to the building's interior. Perched on a wooden beam above the door is a raven. It hops about and squawks at you, seemingly agitated.

- DC 12 Insight -> senses the raven is trying to warn the party
	- After delivering the message, the raven flies off toward the valley below ([[The Town of Vallaki (N)]])

- Beyond the windmill is the forest
	- Once atop the windmill's hill, the characters can see a ring of four squat megaliths at the forest's edge
	- Ravens can be seen circling in the air above the stones (see [[#The Megaliths]])

## Interactions
- [[Morgantha]] is not home when the characters arrive, but her daughters [[Bella Sunbane]] and [[Offalia Wormwiggle]] are there. [[Bella Sunbane|Bella]] is 

## Areas
### Ground Floor
>The ground floor has been converted into a makeshift kitchen, but the room is a bit disorganized and has a musty, lived-in air about it. Baskets and old dishware are piled in one corner. Adding to the clutter is a peddler's cart, a chicken coop, a heavy wooden trunk, and a pretty wooden cabinet with flowers painted on its doors.
>
>There is an open, upright barrel in the center of the room.
>
>Warmth issues from a brick oven against one wall, and a crumbling staircase ascends the wall across from it. You can hear movement upstairs.

If inspecting the barrel:
>As you look into the barrel, the sweet smell of pastries blends horridly with a stench that burns your nostrils.

- The barrel holds glistening, greenish-black demon ichor

- Anyone still addicted knows the smell of the dream pastries right away
- If anyone looks in the oven, they also recognize them
