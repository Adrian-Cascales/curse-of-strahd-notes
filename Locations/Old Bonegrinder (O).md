## Approaching
Read this as the party passes the path that branches toward the windmill

>The Old Svalich Road transitions here from being a winding path through the Balinok Mountains to a lazy trail that hugs the mountainside as it descends into a fog-filled valley. In the heart of the valley you see a walled town near the shores of a great mountain lake, its waters dark and still. A branch in the road leads west to a promontory, atop which is perched a dilapidated stone windmill, its warped wooden vanes stripped bare.

Closer investigation:
>The onion-domed edifice leans forward and to one side,Â like a crippled old woman just trying to get by. You see gray brick walls and dirt-covered windows on the upper floors. A decrepit wooden platform encircles the windmill above a flimsy doorway leading to the building's interior. Perched on a wooden beam above the door is a raven. It hops about and squawks at you, seemingly agitated.

- DC 12 Insight -> senses the raven is trying to warn the party
	- After delivering the message, the raven flies off toward the valley below ([[The Town of Vallaki (N)]])

- Beyond the windmill is the forest
	- Once atop the windmill's hill, the characters can see a ring of four squat megaliths at the forest's edge
	- Ravens can be seen circling in the air above the stones (see [[#The Megaliths]])

## Coming Inside
- [[Morgantha]] is not home when the characters arrive, but her daughters [[Bella Sunbane]] and [[Offalia Wormwiggle]] are there
	- [[Bella Sunbane|Bella]] is somewhere upstairs too, but comes down every now and then to check the pies
	- [[Offalia Wormwiggle|Offalia]] is upstairs running the bone grinder
	- [[Morgantha]] comes in much later disguised as Granny with her cart of pies
		- She also has a large wiggling sack contain a little boy she took as payment [[Lucien]]
  
- All three disguise themselves as old women in their late 50s (daughters) and 70s (Morgantha)
- If the players knock, they hear some shuffling, and [[Bella Sunbane|Bella]] comes to the door
	- [[Bella Sunbane|Bella]] is really friendly and invites them inside
	- They immediately smell the scent of something delicious
	- There is not much room in the windmill for everyone to be comfortable
		- [[Bella Sunbane|Bella]] makes an obvious show of being hospitable by clearing chairs and stuff
		- "We don't usually have guests. I'm so very sorry for not making things nicer"
- If they sneak in, and [[Bella Sunbane|Bella]] hears, she yells down "Mother is that you?"
	- The door is unlocked
- [[Bella Sunbane|Bella]] just calls [[Offalia Wormwiggle|Offalia]] "Sister" because of the sinister name

## Conversation with Bella
- Her sister is upstairs hard at work
	- "Sister! Come say hello to our guests!" "Oh, hush, Bella! I'm working! You know Mother will be home soon."
- Bella's mother is Morgantha and she frequently goes into town for a few days at a time to sell her wares
	- They have a little place in town to stay, but they much prefer the windmill as their home
	- Bella and her sister are the primary bakers in their little business
- Bella is delighted when the players admit that they met her mother and even more so when they admit they tried the pies
	- Bella wants to know the PCs' critiques on the taste and what might possibly make them tastier
	- Bella would love to hear some baking tips
- Bella doesn't talk about the actual content of the pies unless she's specifically asked
	- She admits that it's a family secret passed down from her mother's mother
- If the PCs bring up the witch thing, Bella gets sad and says her mother doesn't really talk about her mother or how she died
	- But Bella knows that it was something terrible.
- If the PCs bring up the deed to the windmill that they obtained from Death House, Bella looks suddenly devastated
	- She tells the PCs that the windmill was abandoned for centuries before their grandmother came to live there
	- "I-Is that why you're here? To kick three old women out of their home? Shame on you!"
- Otherwise, Bella does her best to keep the conversation about the PCs
	- She asks them where they're off to and how they're handling Barovia
	- Better to talk about the PCs than them, after all

## Fighting
- Don't bring [[Morgantha]] in until later, because the party will have hard time beating a complete coven
	- Wait 10-15 turns
	- Don't immediately bring her into combat
- Exploit [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]]'s safety
	- They use their action to disengage from her instead of attacking

## Areas
### Ground Floor
>The ground floor has been converted into a makeshift kitchen, but the room is a bit disorganized and has a musty, lived-in air about it. Baskets and old dishware are piled in one corner. Adding to the clutter is a peddler's cart, a chicken coop, a heavy wooden trunk, and a pretty wooden cabinet with flowers painted on its doors.
>
>There is an open, upright barrel in the center of the room.
>
>A large brick oven takes up most of one side of the room. The oven emits warmth and you can smell something sweet baking inside. Surrounding the oven on some shelves are several jars of condiments and ingredients. There's also a couple rubbish bins filled with animal bones and bits of discarded dough

If inspecting the barrel:
>As you look into the barrel, the sweet smell of pastries blends horridly with a stench that burns your nostrils.

- The barrel holds glistening, greenish-black demon ichor
- Anyone still addicted knows the smell of the dream pastries right away and gets a craving
	- If anyone looks in the oven, they also recognize them as [[Mechanics of Dream Pastries|Dream Pastries]]
- DC15 survival if bones inspected: the bones are actually children bones

Inside the cabinet:
>Wooden bowls full of herbs and baking ingredients, including flour, sugar, and several gourds of an unfamiliar powder. Hanging on the inside of the cabinet doors are a dozen locks of hair. Amid various concoctions are three small, labeled containers that hold elixirs. One is a golden syrup labeled "Youth", the second a red tea labelled "Laughter", and the third a greenish milky liquid labeled "Mother's Milk"

- Youth: magically makes the imbiber appear younger and more attractive for 24 hours
- Laughter:  a nonmagical red tea that infects the imbiber with [[Cackle Fever]]
- Mother's Milk: a dose of [[Pale Tincture (Ingested)]]
- The powder is ground bone: DC 18 survival
