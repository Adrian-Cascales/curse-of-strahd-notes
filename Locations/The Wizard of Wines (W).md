- Druids = Forest Folk

## The Timeline
- **10 Years Ago**
    - The first gem was stolen and never seen again.
- **A Month or so Ago**
    - The forest folk started acting strangely in the woods. [[The Keepers of the Feather|The Martikovs]] started hearing strange stories that they were gathering at [[Yester Hill (Y)|Yester Hill]] for some unknown cause.
    - While [[The Keepers of the Feather|The Martikovs]] of course used their ravens to collect this information, they won't openly tell the players their information gathering methods. Instead, they'll either be vague or lie, saying they heard the news from hunters from Kresk.
- **Three Weeks Ago**
    - The second gem was stolen in the night. There was no great fight or witnesses. However, the Martikovs were able to trace tracks to Berez but haven't dared actually venture into the bogs. They all know it's quite dangerous there.
- **One Week Ago**
    - The [[Forest Folk]] and their blights attacked the winery. The Martikovs were able to defend their home for a time. Remember, they're wereravens and are actually pretty good in combat.
- **Five Days Ago**
    - Two days into the assault, the Forest Folk found and stole the third and final gem.
- **Two Days Ago**
    - The blights were finally too much for the family to fend off and they had to flee the winery. They've been living in the woods since, trying to figure out a way to win back their home.
