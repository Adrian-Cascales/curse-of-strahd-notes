## Nursemaid Encounter
- The party appeases her with the fake baby
- She takes the illusion and sits in the rocking chair with it
- She says the following:
	>Oh Walter, you were so precious when you were born. Of course, you're father wasn't there for it -- that witch of a woman kept him away. But no matter, I loved you all the same. You were the light of my life. I would have been satisfied to simply keep you to myself.

	>But she -- she couldn't stand the thought of you. That's when she started to become manic. The screams from the basement would sometimes wake you up. But you were such a good baby, Walter. I'd rock you right back to sleep.
	
	>But the other children. I always loved them as well -- not as much as you, of course, Walter. But I did love them. I also pitied them. As more and more innocent people were lured into this house, those poor children would spend hours on end locked in their room. They said, of course, that it was to protect their innocence, but what's innocence when you're in a cage?
	
	>Poor baby Walter. You were my light in a dark world. I tried to protect you as best I knew how. But that woman! She couldn't be satisfied until she had you. Or rather, until I no longer had you.

- After a minute, the spell ends, and the fake baby disappears. So does she

## [[Gertruda]]'s Dog
- Maybe let [[Shalooti]] make a nature check after seeing dog prints in the dust
- The dog is hiding under a bed or something somewhere in the house
	- Maybe under the harpsichord
- It's name is [[Lancelot]]
	- It's on the collar and it answers to it
- This gives the players something to sacrifice (if they choose to)

## [[Rosevalda|Rose]] and [[Thornboldt|Thorne]] Round 2
- They have all their memories now
- They know they're dead
	- They look like ghosts; spectral and see-through
 
- They know they were locked away while their parents went to "Deal with the Monster"
