## Locations
### Entering the Camp
- Draw a stark contrast between what they've seen so far ([[Locations/Death House]] and [[Village of Barovia (E)]])
	- These people are colorful and having fun singing and drinking around the fire

### [[Madam Eva]]'s Tent
- When she does the [[Card Reading]], roll out the "black velvet" cloth that you packed
	- Maybe write all the pre-picked cards on index cards, and completely move the DM screen
- Practice some sleight of hand for picking the cards
- Have her character wait for silence before reading the next card
