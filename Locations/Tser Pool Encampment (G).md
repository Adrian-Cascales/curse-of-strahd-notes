## Prep
- [ ] Separate card decks
- [ ] Take out the prepped cards
- [ ] Before the session, once everyone is at the table, ask someone to shuffle each deck

## Locations
### Entering the Camp
- Draw a stark contrast between what they've seen so far ([[Death House]] and [[Village of Barovia (E)]])
	- These people are colorful and having fun singing and drinking around the fire
- When the party enters, as soon as a [[Vistani|Vistana]] catches sight, have them call out like they've just seen a long lost friend
	- The party is ushered in around the fire and given food and wine
- One or two of the [[Vistani]] should be the main NPCs in the camp
	- [[Arahja]] doing most of the talking and [[Rina]] chiming in every now and then
- There are 12 bandits that are drinking and 3 sober bandit captains

### Questions for and from the Group
- At the campfire [[Arahja]] may ask the group:
	- where they're from
	- where they're headed
	- how they ended up here
	- what they thought of [[Village of Barovia (E)|Barovia Village]]
- The group may ask about
	- [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] or the land:
		- [[Vistani#Vistani Lore|Vistani Lore]]
	- The story of the [[Vistani]] and [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]]:
		- They're happy to tell about how their understanding with [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] came to pass ([[Vistani#The Vistani and Strahd Von Zarovich Strahd|The Vistani and Strahd]])
	- [[Village of Barovia (E)#Vistani Owners|The Vistani from the Blood on the Vine Tavern]]:
		- When mentioned, the Vistani at the fire spit on the ground and swear "Mortu!"
		- They advise the party to stay away from filth like that
	- {Don't mention the name of the windmill}

#### Trapped in Barovia
- One way or another, work this into conversation
	- Maybe make a passing joke:
 
>Look at this one, Rina! His skin is so tan! Almost like Vistani, himself, eh?
>Yes, show it off while you can, Giorgio. The coming years without sunlight are sure to steal it from you.

- When the players ask why, the Vistani somberly tell them that no one leaves Barovia
	- Once in the mists, you're here forever "So welcome to your new home"
- When the players ask how they might escape this land
	- The Vistani don't know, but recommend talking to [[Madam Eva]]
		- If there's any chance of escape, she'd know it

### [[Madam Eva]]'s Tent
- She calls for them to enter as approach the tent, and before they announce themselves
- She addresses them all by name without introduction
>I've been awaiting your arrival. I see that fate has indeed led you to me. Are you ready to learn your fate?

- If pressed:
>My cards grant me sight into the Threads of Fate that bind us all. They told me that champions were coming to the land and that I would guide them on their path.

#### Card Reading
>	Madam Eva clears the table in the middle of the room. She takes out a roll of black velvet from a chest nearby and carefully rolls it out on the table. From the chest she also pulls a crystal ball, and a deck of cards. You've all seen these cards before in your dream. She then cuts the cards into two separate decks, and begins to draw from the top, laying the cards in a cross shape in the middle of the table.   
- When she does the [[Card Reading]], roll out the "black velvet" cloth that you packed
	- Maybe write all the pre-picked cards on index cards, and completely move the DM screen
- Practice some sleight of hand for picking the cards
- Have her character wait for silence before reading the next card
