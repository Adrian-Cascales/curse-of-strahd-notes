## Locations
### Entering the Camp
- Draw a stark contrast between what they've seen so far ([[Death House]] and [[Village of Barovia (E)]])
	- These people are colorful and having fun singing and drinking around the fire
- When the party enters, as soon as a [[Vistani|Vistana]] catches sight, have them call out like they've just seen a long lost friend
	- The party is ushered in and given food and wine.
- One or two of the [[Vistani]] should be the main NPCs in the camp

### [[Madam Eva]]'s Tent
- When she does the [[Card Reading]], roll out the "black velvet" cloth that you packed
	- Maybe write all the pre-picked cards on index cards, and completely move the DM screen
- Practice some sleight of hand for picking the cards
- Have her character wait for silence before reading the next card
