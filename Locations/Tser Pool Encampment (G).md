## Locations
### Entering the Camp
- Draw a stark contrast between what they've seen so far ([[Death House]] and [[Village of Barovia (E)]])
	- These people are colorful and having fun singing and drinking around the fire
- When the party enters, as soon as a [[Vistani|Vistana]] catches sight, have them call out like they've just seen a long lost friend
	- The party is ushered in around the fire and given food and wine
- One or two of the [[Vistani]] should be the main NPCs in the camp
	- [[Arahja]] doing most of the talking and [[Rina]] chiming in every now and then
- There are 12 bandits that are drinking and 3 sober bandit captains

### Questions for and from the Group
- At the campfire [[Arahja]] may ask the group:
	- where they're from
	- where they're headed
	- how they ended up here
	- what they thought of [[Village of Barovia (E)|Barovia Village]]
- The group may ask about [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] or the land:
	- [[Vistani#Vistani Lore|Visatni Lore]]
 

### [[Madam Eva]]'s Tent
- When she does the [[Card Reading]], roll out the "black velvet" cloth that you packed
	- Maybe write all the pre-picked cards on index cards, and completely move the DM screen
- Practice some sleight of hand for picking the cards
- Have her character wait for silence before reading the next card
