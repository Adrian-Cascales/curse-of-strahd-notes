## Events (p 48)
### Dream Pies ([source](https://www.reddit.com/r/CurseofStrahd/comments/8xu9lo/fleshing_out_curse_of_strahd_the_village_of/))

[[Mechanics of Dream Pastries]]
- Run this event when the players first leave Death House
- Read:
	> You hear the sound of small, wooden wheels rolling across damp cobbles. You trace the lonely sound to a hunched figure huddled in rags, pushing a rickety wooden cart through the fog. The figure approaches the door of a nearby home and knocks
- if approaching:
	> You catch a delicious smell on the air. You see that the figure is an old lady. She's just handed something to the person in the house, and he is thanking her profusely
- The players meet [[Morgantha]] selling her dream pastries
	- She's in the guise of an old woman and has come from [[Old Bonegrinder]] to sell her pastries
- She has a small variety of pies (they don't have to be meat. Just contain kid parts like ground up bones)
	- Meat pies, maple nut pies, and a hearty pie with a potato base
	- if asked the type of meat:
		> Oh, Barovians use all kinds of meat. Especially since we've a dreadful lack of sunlight for good fruits and veggies. I myself prefer chicken, but there's also goat, deer, pig, and wolf meat depending on where you go. You'd think wolf meat would be more of delicacy, huh? Not here, dearie! With Lord Strahd in charge there's more wolves in these woods than we know what to do with!
- The pastries normally cost 1gp each
	- but she will gift the party a pie to share for dinner (she won't take no for an answer)
		- She waves the fee because they're new to Barovia and their journey into town must have been hard
- When she explains why they're so expensive:
	- it's a bit of magic her mother taught her before the witch killed her
	- The pies bring the eaters only the sweetest of dreams, something poorly lacking in this dreary world (make her seem grief stricken by the state of the world)
- She'll point them to the [[Blood on the Vine Tavern]]
