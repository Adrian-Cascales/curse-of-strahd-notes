[[Mechanics of Dream Pastries]]
- Run this event when the players first leave Death House
- Read:
	> You hear the sound of small, wooden wheels rolling across damp cobbles. You trace the lonely sound to a hunched figure huddled in rags, pushing a rickety wooden cart through the fog. The figure approaches the door of a nearby home and knocks
- if approaching:
	> You catch a delicious smell on the air. You see that the figure is an old lady. She's just handed something to the person in the house, and he is thanking her profusely
- The players meet [[Morgantha]] selling her dream pastries
	- She's in the guise of an old woman and has come from [[Old Bonegrinder]] to sell her pastries
- She has a small variety of pies (they don't have to be meat. Just contain kid parts like ground up bones)
	- Meat pies, maple nut pies, and a hearty pie with a potato base
- The pastries cost 1gp each
