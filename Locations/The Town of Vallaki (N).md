## Laws
- No one shall speak Strahd's name out loud or carry written documents with his name on them
- No one shall speak poorly of the Baron or the festivals nor hold any documents that present either in an ill light
- Everyone shall take part in preparing the festivals
	- The Vallakians treat this sort of like Jury Duty
- Everyone shall attend the festivals
	- Every festival, guards go door to door and patrol the streets to make sure no one is missing out
	- Of course, they can't actually check everywhere, so hiding isn't impossible
	- But getting caught avoiding a festival is grounds for a steep punishment
- Regular laws apply
	- e.g. murdering a civilian would result in incarceration, but murdering a guard would mean execution
 
### Punishments
- Time in stocks between a day to a few weeks
- Seizure of assets
- Imprisonment at Vallaki's Reformation House
- Personal reformation conducted by [[Vargas Vallakovich|The Baron]]
	- He chooses a random dissenter and takes them to his mansion for hands-on torture
- public hanging
	- doesn't happen often, and reserved for severe dissenters that repeat offense

## Locations
### The Gates
>The Old Svalich Road meanders into a valley watched over by dark, brooding mountains to the north and south. The woods recede, revealing a sullen mountain burg surrounded by a wooden palisade. Thick fog presses up against this wall, as though looking for a way inside, hoping to catch the town aslumber.
>
>The dirt road ends at a set of sturdy iron gates with a pair of shadowy figures standing behind them. Planted in the ground and flanking the road outside the gates are a half-dozen pikes with wolves' heads impaled on them.

When approaching:
>One of the figures just inside the gate, yells out "Who goes there?"

Guard names: [[Valentin Ulrich]] and [[Alana Ivanova]]

- A 15-foot-high wall encloses the town, its vertical logs held together with thick ropes and mortar. The top of each log has been sharpened to a point. Wooden scaffolding hugs the inside of the palisade twelve feet off the ground, enabling guards to peer over the wall there

- Three tall gates made of iron bars lead into town:
	- The north gate is sometimes called the Zarovich Gate, or "the gate to the lake," because it leads to Lake Zarovich (chapter 2, area L).
	- The west gate is referred to as the Sunset Gate, even though no living person in Vallaki has seen an undimmed sunset. A few abandoned cottages line the road outside this gate.
	- The east gate is also known as the Morning Gate, or, as some locals like to call it, the Mourning Gate.
- Heavy iron chains with iron padlocks keep the gates shut at night
	- During the day, the gates are closed but not typically locked
- Two town [[#Statblocks|wall guards]] stand just inside each gate
	- The guards greet all visitors with suspicion, particularly those who arrive at night
	- If the characters arrive at night, one or more of them must succeed on a DC 20 Charisma (Persuasion) check to convince the guards to unlock the gate and let them enter
- If trouble breaks out at one of the gates, the guards there cry out, "To arms!"
	- Their shouts are echoed across Vallaki, putting the entire town on alert within minutes
	- Vallaki has twenty-four human [[guard|guards]], half of whom are on duty at any given time
		- (six stand watch at the gates, six patrol the walls)
		- The town can also muster a militia of fifty able-bodied human [[#Statblocks|Vallaki Commoners]]

#### Interrogation
- The point is to make it clear that [[The Town of Vallaki (N)|Vallaki]] takes itself seriously
**Before opening the gates**:
- Who are you (Who goes there)
- What's your business in town?
	- Just looking for anything suspicious
	- If the PCs seem doubtful, have the guards latch onto that doubt and drill them
- (optional) What is your relation to [[Strahd Von Zarovich]]?
	- They want to filter out [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] supporters
- [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]]'s family name is well know, and she can help with any mistakes here
	- She'll happily present herself to the guards
 
**The Laws of Vallaki**:
- Open the gates
- Have the guards give them a rundown of Vallaki law:

>Once inside, the mention of the name "Strahd" is strictly illegal, even in written form. Know that even now as I say the name, it is the last time you will hear it within the gates. Instead, if you must refer to the aforementioned individual, you will refer to him simply as, "The Devil."
>
>This noble town holds a festival each week in honor of the resident's general merriment and continued support of the Burgomaster, Baron Vargas Vallakovich. As guests of Vallaki, you will not be required to aid in the preparation for our festivals. However, your attendance and participation in each and every festival is absolutely mandatory for the length of your stay. Failure to attend will be in strict opposition to Vallakian law. The next great Vallakian festival, the Festival of the Blazing Sun, will be held in three days time in the town square.
>
>Failure to comply with any Vallakian law will mark you as criminals to our city and you will be punished as such in accordance to our justice system. If you have any questions, now is the time to ask them.

- Reinforce these laws as much as necessary
- If asked about:
	- **the festivals**: the guards explain them in the most positive light
	- **punishment**: only the basics; anywhere between a fine, imprisonment, or in severe cases, execution

**Weapons Registry**
- Before letting them into town, the guards ask the party to present their weapons for registry
- For each character, a scribe will write a quick sheet with their description, and name as well as a description of all their gear
- **Fake Name**: DC12 deception
- **Hide Weapon**: slight of hand against guard's passive perception
- If caught, guard will just get annoyed and ask for the truth

**Inside**
- After all this, they let the party in
>This town is absolutely bustling. The streets are teeming with people, far more than you remember seeing in the empty streets of [[Village of Barovia (E)|Barovia Village]]. And some of them even seem to be... smiling. This place almost strikes you as normal. At least compared to the places you've seen thus far in this godforsaken realm.

- The players will probably head west through town from the eastern gate
	- unless they fixate on a specific building, go ahead and skip [[#Arasek Stockyard (N5)]] and [[#Coffin Maker's Shop (N6)]]
	- They'll probably be heading to the [[#Blue Water Inn (N2)]] from a townie's advice, or to [[#St Andral's Church (N1)]] on [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]]'s request
	- They land in [[#Town Square (N8)]]

### House Occupants
- If the characters explore a residence other than the burgomaster's mansion, roll a d20 and consult the following table to determine the house's occupant:

|d20|Occupant|
|---|---|
|1-3|None|
|4-5|2d4 [[Swarm of Rats]]|
|6-18|Vallakian townsfolk|
|19-20|Vallakian [[Cultist]]|

- **Rats**: A house infested with rats appears abandoned at first. The rats are servants of Strahd and attack if the characters explore the interior of the house
- **Townsfolk**: A house of Vallakian townsfolk contains 1d4 adults (LG male and female human [[Commoner]]s and 1d8-1 children (LG male and female human noncombatants)
	- Anyone who listens at the door hears chatter from within
	- Townsfolk won't willingly invite strangers into their homes, but they will speak with characters from behind closed doors or while standing in their vestibules
- **Cultists**: A cult haven contains 2d4 Vallakian adults (LE male and female [[Cultist]]s  and one [[Cult Fanatic]] (LE male or female) who leads them in prayer or orchestrates ritual sacrifices
	- These cultists worship devils and consider [[Fiona Wachter|Lady Fiona Wachter]] to be their spiritual leader.

### St Andral's Church (N1)

### Blue Water Inn (N2)
>Gray smoke issues from the chimney of this large, two-story wooden building with a stone foundation and sagging tile roof, upon which several ravens have perched. A painted wooden sign hanging above the main entrance depicts a blue waterfall.

- A bed for the night costs 1 ep
	- Characters looking for something to eat are fed hot beet soup and fresh bread at no additional charge
	- A cooked wolf steak costs 1 ep
- The inn offers a pint of Purple Grapemash No. 3 wine for 3 cp, or a pint of the superior Red Dragon Crush wine for 1 sp
	- [[Urwin Martikov|Urwin]] is hurt if the characters complain about the wines, for his family makes them
- The inn's wine supply is almost depleted, and the latest delivery from the Wizard of Wines winery is overdue
	- If the characters claim to be adventurers, [[Urwin Martikov|Urwin]] asks them if they would be so kind as to find out what's holding up the latest shipment
- At any given time, another 1d4 [[wereraven]]s (members of [[The Keepers of the Feather]]) are present at the inn, either perched on the rooftop in raven form or huddled inside in human form
	- These wereravens are loyal friends of the Martikovs and help protect the inn

#### Interactions
- The place is lively and homey

#### Well (N2a)
A 3-foot-high stone rim surrounds the mouth of this 40-foot-deep, moss-lined well. The inn draws fresh water from this well.

#### Outside Staircase (N2b)
A wooden staircase hugs the outer wall of the inn and leads up to guest quarters on the upper floor (areas N2l and N2m). The sturdy wooden door at the top of the stairs can be barred from the inside.

#### Taproom (N2c)
>Damp cloaks hang from pegs in the entrance portico. The tavern is packed with tables and chairs, with narrow paths meandering between them. A bar stretches along one wall, under a balcony that can be reached by a wooden staircase that hugs the north wall. Another balcony overhangs an entrance to the east. All the windows are fitted with thick shutters and crossbars. Lanterns hanging above the bar and resting on the tables bathe the room in dull orange light and cast shadows upon the walls, most of which are adorned with wolf heads mounted on wooden plaques.

- [[Danika Dorakova]] usually tends bar while [[Urwin Martikov]] busies himself in the kitchen
	- [[Brom Martikova|Brom]] and [[Bray Martikova|Bray]] scamper about
- Between dawn and noon, there are no patrons here, and the Martikovs are upstairs in their bedrooms (areas N2o and N2p) or in the attic (area N2q).
	- From noon to dusk, the taproom holds 2d4 local patrons
	- Between dusk and midnight, 2d8 Vallakians are here
	- In addition, one or more of the following people might be present during this time:
		- **Wolf Hunters**:  [[Szoldar Szoldarovich]] and [[Yevgeni Krushkin]] are local hunters who frequent the Blue Water Inn. They kill wolves and sell the meat for a living, and their work is dangerous and bloody
			- Both men are grim and have haunted looks in their eyes
		- **Wachter Brothers**: [[Nikolai Wachter|Nikolai]] and [[Karl Wachter]] are brothers of noble birth
			- They are brash drunkards always looking for trouble, though they are smart enough not to pick fights with well-armed strangers
		- **Rictavio**: The lone guest of the Blue Water Inn at present is a colorfully dressed half-elf bard who goes by the name [[Rictavio]]
			- He regales tavern patrons with stories so outrageous as to be hardly believable, yet he asserts they are true indeed
			- He claims to be a carnival ringmaster from a distant land
			- He's been staying at the inn for almost a month, taking advantage of [[Urwin Martikov]]'s generosity and good nature
			- When he arrived, he was accompanied by a monkey named Piccolo
				- The monkey wasn't welcome at the inn, so [[Rictavio]] gave it to the local toymaker (see [[#Blinsky Toys (N7)]]).

#### Wine Storage (N2d)
>This hallway contains three curtained alcoves as well as a larger area stuffed with wine barrels.

- The Martikovs store their wine here
- Tucked behind red curtains are three alcoves, each one containing a half-emptied wine barrel lying on its side in a wooden brace
	- Twelve empty wine barrels are piled two high near the door to the kitchen (area N2e)
	- All the barrels have the [[The Wizard of Wines (W)|Wizard of Wines]] name burned into them
- Nine of the fifteen barrels, including two of the barrels in the curtained alcoves, have the following label burned into their sides, under the winery's name: Purple Grapemash No. 3.
- Six of the fifteen barrels, including one of the barrels in the curtained alcoves, have a different label: Red Dragon Crush.
- The double doors that lead outside can be barred shut from within.

#### Kitchen (N2e)
>This room looks like the kitchen of someone who loves to cook. It has piles of pots, walls lined with utensils and shelves of ingredients, and all manner of pleasant odors. Two lanterns hang above a sturdy pine worktable in the middle of the clutter. A pot of soup bubbles on the hearth.

- [[Urwin Martikov]] is found here during the day
- A cupboard against the east wall holds most of the inn's supply of cutlery and dishware, none of it valuable
- A door in the west wall leads outside and is usually barred from the inside
- {A secret door at the west end of the south wall can be pushed open to reveal a wooden staircase that leads up to [[#Secret Stairs and Hall (N2i)]]}

#### Stable (N2f)
- The sliding wooden doors on the west wall of this room are held shut by an iron lock and chain
	- [[Urwin Martikov|Urwin]] carries the key to the lock
	- The doors to the north and south can be barred shut from the inside but are usually unlocked
 
>You hear the squawking of birds and the plaintive whinny of a horse as you peer inside this stable. The stalls are clean and well maintained. One of them contains a gray mare. A small door is set into the east wall, and a wooden ladder gives access to a loft overhead. Perched on the wooden railing that encloses the loft are dozens of ravens.

- Any character who has a horse can keep it here for 1 sp per night. The gray mare is a [[draft horse]] named Drusilla, and she likes apples
	- The horse belongs to [[Rictavio]]
- The small door in the east wall can be pulled open to reveal [[#Storage (N2g)]]
	- The loft is described in [[#Raven's Loft (N2h)]]

#### Storage (N2g)
- This small room lies under a wooden staircase ([[#Secret Stairs and Hall (N2i)]])
- Hanging from wooden pegs are saddles and barding to equip two horses
- In an unlocked wooden chest are a dozen horseshoes, a wooden mallet, and a mound of horseshoe nails

#### Raven's Loft (N2h)
>Dim light spilling in through a pair of dirt-encrusted windows reveals piles of hay with pitchforks sticking out of them. Ravens rule this roost—you can see hundreds of them.

- Characters who search the loft thoroughly find three pitchforks and a locked wooden chest buried under a pile of hay (see "Treasure" below), next to a secret door
- If the characters tamper with the chest, the ravens gather into four [[Swarm of Ravens]] and attack
	- If two swarms are killed, the others flee
	- Otherwise, they cease their attacks if the characters leave the chest alone
	- If the fighting continues for more than 3 rounds, [[Urwin Martikov]] and two other [[Wereraven]]s hear the ruckus and investigate (in human form)

- A secret door in the back of the loft can be pushed open to reveal a bedchamber ([[#Master Bedroom (N2p)]]) beyond
	- No ability check is required to spot the secret door, because light in the room beyond slips through the door's cracks

**Treasure**
- Inside the locked chest are 140 ep, 70 pp, two [[Elixir of health]] [elixirs of health](http://longo.com.br/5e/items.html#elixir%20of%20health_dmg), three [[reference/items/Potion of Healing|Potion of Healing]], and a gray [[Bag of Tricks]]
	- The coins are embossed with the profiled likeness of Strahd von Zarovich

#### Secret Stairs and Hall (N2i)
>A wooden staircase to the north descends fifteen feet to a landing. A window dimly illuminates a short, wood-paneled hallway that runs west to east.

- Guests aren't told about the inn's secret hallway
	- [[Rictavio]] knows of its existence because he has heard the Martikov boys opening and closing the secret door closest to his room ([[#Private Guest Room (N2n)]])

- At each end of this area is a secret door, each of which is easy to spot from inside the hallway (no ability check required)
	- The northern secret door, at the bottom of the staircase, can be pulled open to reveal the kitchen ([[#Kitchen (N2e)]]) beyond
	- The eastern secret door can be pulled open to reveal a balcony ([[#Great Balcony (N2j)]]) that overlooks the taproom

#### Great Balcony (N2j)
>A wooden balcony stretches the full length of the taproom, enclosed by a wooden railing carved with raven motifs. The taproom's many lanterns illuminate the rafters and cast ominous shadows on the peaked ceiling.

- The balcony floor is 15 feet above the taproom floor
- A secret door at the south end of the western wall can be pushed open to reveal a wood-paneled hallway ([[#Secret Stairs and Hall (N2i)]]) beyond

#### Guest Balcony (N2k)
>This twenty-foot-long balcony provides a clear view of the bar and has a wooden railing carved with raven motifs. The taproom's many lanterns illuminate the rafters and cast ominous shadows on the peaked ceiling.

- **Navigation Shortcuts**:  The balcony floor is 15 feet above the taproom floor.

#### Guest Rooms (N2l)
- These two rooms have identical furnishings

>Two cozy beds with matching footlockers rest in the far corners of this fifteen-foot-square room. Wolf furs are heaped atop each bed. Between the beds, a lamp sits on a table under a shuttered window. Two tall black wardrobes stand against the wall by the door.

- The door to this room can be locked from the inside, and each guest gets a key
	- [[Urwin Martikov|Urwin]] and [[Danika Dorakova|Danika]] carry spare keys
	- The footlockers and wardrobes are empty and are for the use of guests

#### Guest Room (N2m)
>Four plain beds with straw mattresses line the north wall of this well-lit room. Each bed comes with a matching footlocker to store clothing and other belongings. A table and four chairs occupy the corner across from the door. An oil lamp resting on the table casts a bright yellow flame.

- The door to this room can be locked from the inside, and each guest receives a key
	- [[Urwin Martikov|Urwin]] and [[Danika Dorakova|Danika]] carry spare keys
	- The footlockers are empty and are for the use of guests

#### Private Guest Room (N2n)
- [[Rictavio]] has a key to this room, which is locked at all times
	- [[Urwin Martikov|Urwin]] and [[Danika Dorakova|Danika]] carry spare keys
	- The door's lock can be picked, but discretion is called for because the door is in plain view of the taproom below

>This small guest room contains a bed heaped with wolf furs, a footlocker, a tall wardrobe, and a writing desk with matching chair. An oil lamp rests atop the desk near a journal bound in a red leather jacket.

- [[Rictavio]] sleeps here between midnight and dawn
	- At dawn, he leaves to check on his horse ([[#Stable (N2f)]]) and his wagon ([[#Arasek Stockyard (N5)]]), returning to the inn around noon
	- Between noon and dusk, there's a 40 percent chance he is here; otherwise, he's in the taproom ([[#Taproom (N2c)]])
	- At dusk, he leaves the inn to tend to his horse and his wagon again, then returns to his room to retire for the night
- [[Rictavio]] is too clever to leave anything valuable or incriminating in his room
	- The footlocker and the wardrobe contain nothing but common clothes and travel wear

**[[Rictavio]]'s Journal**
	The journal on the desk is a bit of artifice that [[Rictavio]] created to perpetuate the illusion that he is an entertainer in search of new acts for his traveling carnival. His writing makes frequent mention of conversations with Drusilla (which the journal fails to mention is the name of his horse) and recounts many long and tedious journeys by wagon. He has also written about various "oddities" he has seen in his travels, including the following:
- A "werehare" child (a boy who transforms into a rabbit on nights of the full moon)
- A half-orc woman named Gorabacha who could chew through iron chains
- A giant, man-eating plant that had the most remarkable singing voice
- A pair of conjoined goblins
- A small man with no legs named Filmore Stunk, who could drink whole casks of wine without getting drunk

#### Boys' Bedroom (N2o)
>A large, painted toy box rests between two small, cozy beds. Murals of ravens in flight are painted on the walls above the wood paneling.

- [[Brom Martikova|Brom]] and [[Bray Martikova]] don't spend much time in this room
- The toy box contains a pile of neglected toys, many of them etched with the slogan "Is No Fun, Is No Blinsky!" The toys include the following:
	- A miniature puppet theater with appropriately sized marionettes of a king, a queen, a prince, a princess, an executioner, a tax collector, a dunce, a vampire, and a vampire hunter
	- A garish toy Vistani wagon hitched to a wooden horse and filled with tiny wooden Vistani figures
	- A pair of painted wooden clown masks, one displaying a mean scowl and the other a frightened expression
	- A wooden top painted with images of scarecrows chasing children through the forest
	- A stuffed (real) bat on puppet strings

- A hidden trapdoor in the 8-foot-high ceiling opens into a secret attic ([[#Secret Attic (N2q)]]).

#### Master Bedroom (N2p)
>Matching end tables flank a large wood-framed bed with a red silk canopy. Across from the bed hangs a tapestry depicting a beautiful mountain valley. The other walls are dominated by a fireplace and a wardrobe.

- [[Urwin Martikov|Urwin]] and [[Danika Dorakova|Danika]] retire to this room every night before heading to the attic ([[#Secret Attic (N2q)]]) to sleep
	- This room is for appearances only and contains no valuables
- A secret door at the west end of the south wall can be pulled open to reveal the loft beyond ([[#Raven's Loft (N2h)]]).
- A hidden trapdoor in the 8-foot-high ceiling opens into a secret attic ([[#Secret Attic (N2q)]]).

#### Secret Attic (N2q)
>This ten-foot-wide, thirty-five-foot-long attic has a ceiling that slants down toward the west, dropping from a height of eight feet to a height of five feet. Four straw nests cover the floor, and a locked iron strongbox sits against the north wall. A small square opening in the south wall leads outside. Two trapdoors with iron hinges are set into the floor.

- The Martikovs sleep here at night in hybrid form
	- The opening in the south wall is just big enough for a raven or other Tiny creature to pass through
	- The wereravens can use this opening as an escape route
- The strongbox is described in "Treasure" below
- Two trapdoors, clearly visible on the floor, can be pulled open to reveal the bedchambers (areas N2o and N2p) that lie directly beneath them.

**Treasure**
[[Urwin Martikov|Urwin]] carries the key to the locked iron strongbox. The lock can be picked with thieves' tools and a successful DC 20 Dexterity check. The box contains a sack of 150 ep (each coin bearing the profiled visage of Strahd von Zarovich), six pieces of jewelry (worth 250 gp each), and three [[reference/items/Potion of Healing|Potion of Healing]].


### Burgomaster's Mansion (N3)
in [[Izek Strazni|Izek]]'s room: "You open the door to a rather Spartan bedroom. There's the bed a chest of drawers and some shelves. Or rather, it would be sparse if it weren't filled with hundreds of handmade dolls. And they all... look... just like... YOU."

### Wachterhaus (N4)

### Arasek Stockyard (N5)

### Coffin Maker's Shop (N6)

### Blinsky Toys (N7)

### Town Square (N8)
>The shops and homes that enclose the town square are decorated with limp, tattered garlands and painted wooden boxes filled with tiny, dead flowers. In the middle of the square is a large wooden platform about four feet tall. This square stage features stocks lined up around the edges and facing outward towards the rest of the town square, locked in which are several men, women, and children wearing crude, plaster donkey heads on full display. In the center of this platform is an empty gallows, a trio of nooses hanging ready and waiting.
>
>Off to the side of the square, peasants in patchwork clothes eye you suspiciously as they use cups and vases to draw water from a crumbling stone fountain. Standing tall at the center of the fountain is a gray statue of an impressive man facing west. Throughout the square, you notice guards like those at the gate patrolling the area. All around the square are posted proclamations:

- [[Old Vallaki Proclamation]]
- Most Vallakians have no idea whom the statue in the square represents. The burgomaster claims it is [[Boris Vallakovich]], his ancestor and the town's founder, but there's no noticeable family resemblance.
- Other stages off to the side for festivals
- **The townsfolk in the stocks**
	- arrested for "malicious unhappiness" (spreading negative opinions about the upcoming festival)
	- An iron padlock secures each set of stocks
	- [[Izek Strazni]] carries the keys on an iron ring
	- Three men, two women, and two boys are trapped in the stocks—all of them tired, wet, and famished
		- The five adults have the statistics of human [[commoner]]
		- the children are noncombatants
		- The plaster donkey heads they wear are meant to encourage ridicule.
	- Freeing one or more prisoners without [[Vargas Vallakovich|The Baron]]'s consent is a crime
		- If the characters try:
			- A townie may first try to stop them, saying they're acting like barbarians and warning of [[Izek Strazni|Izek]]
			- The patrolling guards notice
				- [[Izek Strazni|Izek]] arrives quickly with 24 town [[guard]]s (twenty-four in all) and orders the characters to stop what they're doing
				- If [[Izek Strazni|Izek]]'s sibling is present, he notices and takes the party to come back to the [[#Burgomaster's Mansion (N3)]]
				- The party may be punished for their crimes depending on the severity
- **Townies**:
	- [[Danya Karushkin]] glares at them and tells them to get lost
	- [[Isabella Radova]] wears a strained smile and tells the party only propaganda
		- advocates the stocks and wonderous nature of [[Vargas Vallakovich|The Baron]] who keeps them safe from [[Strahd Von Zarovich|The Devil]]
	- [[Yesper Taltos]] gestures them over as he puts up posters for the upcoming festival
		- He tells of [[Vargas Vallakovich|The Baron]]'s strict rule in hushed, cautious tones
		- warns the party about breaking the law, for the punishments are far from just
			- Tells them he once saw [[Vargas Vallakovich|The Burgomaster]]'s henchman, [[Izek Strazni]] publicly chop off the finger of someone who refused to attend a festival


### Vistani Camp (N9)

## Scenario If-Thens
- **PCs openly break laws or antagonize [[Vargas Vallakovich|The Baron]] -> The guards will come down hard**
	- people would snitch if they do this in private
	- guilty until proven innocent
- **[[Izek Strazni|Izek]] sees his sibling -> He immediately recognizes them and is so excited, he freaks everyone out**
- **PCs are arrested -> [[Izek Strazni|Izek]] comes around pretty quickly**
	- If a minor ordeal: [[Izek Strazni|Izek]] will use his authority to excuse the party and try to get them to the [[#Burgomaster's Mansion (N3)|Burgomaster's mansion]] where he says they'll be safe
		- gives them a good chance to explore the mansion since they have his permission to be there
	- If not minor: he will do what he must to follow the law and keep his sibling safe
		- he's ok executing another party member that isn't his sibling
	- If the sibling commits terrible crimes: he actively betrays Vallaki
- **[[Fiona Wachter|Fiona]] gets wind of PCs from spies -> she believes one of them is her messiah ([[Pelanil]] since he is a Cleric who believes in the power of light)**
	- She will go ahead and initiate her plan to overthrow [[Vargas Vallakovich|Burgomaster Vallakovich]] at the [[#Festival of the Blazing Sun]]
	- She'll try to convince the party to join her side also by lamenting what a horrible leader [[Vargas Vallakovich|Vargas]] is
- **PCs waylay the guards -> [[Izek Strazni|Izek]] retreats to [[#Burgomaster's Mansion (N3)|The Mansion]], and they get the run of the town**
- **PCs lose their weapons -> The [[The Keepers of the Feather]] steal them back and eventually return them**
- **PCs are wanted and running -> The Martikovs will hide them in the attic/hayloft of [[#Blue Water Inn (N2)]]**
- **PCs side with [[Fiona Wachter|Lady Wachter]] and revolution takes place** -> [[Vargas Vallakovich|The Baron]] won't be killed, but taken prisoner, tortured, and paraded around town
	- Roll to see how many guards die in riot (describe them as being lynched by the mob)
	- [[Lydia Petrovna|Lydia]] and [[Victor Vallakovich|Victor]] will be left alone, but will be public outcasts
- **PCs side with [[Vargas Vallakovich|Vargas]]** -> He asks them to find proof of [[Fiona Wachter|Lady Wachter]]'s foul plans
	- If they do, [[Vargas Vallakovich|Vargas]] sends every guard not on gate duty to [[#Wachterhaus (N4)|Wachterhaus]] and drag her to the center of town for public execution
	- They'll be a fight at [[#Wachterhaus (N4)]]
	- The next night after [[Fiona Wachter|Fiona]]'s death, her most loyal cultists will break into the [[#Burgomaster's Mansion (N3)]] and assassinate [[Vargas Vallakovich|Vargas]]
- **The party goes to the [[#Coffin Maker's Shop (N6)|Coffin Shop]] looking for bones** -> [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] is alerted, and shows up within a few hours on [[Beucephalus]]
	- Makes a show of riding through town, and sets his vampire spawn (6 of them) loose on the town and the church (if not consecrated)
	- If [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] is safe, he's pissed
	- If she's not safe, he tries to charm her into coming with him
	- Then, at the [[#Festival of the Blazing Sun]], the public unrest boils over into full blown panic
		- A mob erupts against [[Vargas Vallakovich|The Baron]] and his men (worse than [[Fiona Wachter|Fiona's]] revolution would have been
		- [[Vargas Vallakovich|Vargas]] and [[Lydia Petrovna|Lydia]] are lynched in the middle of town, and the mansion burned down
		- fires spread, and there is city-wide looting
