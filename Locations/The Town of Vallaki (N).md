aliases: [Vallaki, The Town of Vallaki]

## Laws
- No one shall speak Strahd's name out loud or carry written documents with his name on them
- No one shall speak poorly of the Baron or the festivals nor hold any documents that present either in an ill light
- Everyone shall take part in preparing the festivals
	- The Vallakians treat this sort of like Jury Duty
- Everyone shall attend the festivals
	- Every festival, guards go door to door and patrol the streets to make sure no one is missing out
	- Of course, they can't actually check everywhere, so hiding isn't impossible
	- But getting caught avoiding a festival is grounds for a steep punishment
- Regular laws apply
	- e.g. murdering a civilian would result in incarceration, but murdering a guard would mean execution
 
### Punishments
- Time in stocks between a day to a few weeks
- Seizure of assets
- Imprisonment at Vallaki's Reformation House
- Personal reformation conducted by [[Vargas Vallakovich|The Baron]]
	- He chooses a random dissenter and takes them to his mansion for hands-on torture
- public hanging
	- doesn't happen often, and reserved for severe dissenters that repeat offense

## Locations
### The Gates
>The Old Svalich Road meanders into a valley watched over by dark, brooding mountains to the north and south. The woods recede, revealing a sullen mountain burg surrounded by a wooden palisade. Thick fog presses up against this wall, as though looking for a way inside, hoping to catch the town aslumber.
>
>The dirt road ends at a set of sturdy iron gates with a pair of shadowy figures standing behind them. Planted in the ground and flanking the road outside the gates are a half-dozen pikes with wolves' heads impaled on them.

- A 15-foot-high wall encloses the town, its vertical logs held together with thick ropes and mortar. The top of each log has been sharpened to a point. Wooden scaffolding hugs the inside of the palisade twelve feet off the ground, enabling guards to peer over the wall there

- Three tall gates made of iron bars lead into town:
	- The north gate is sometimes called the Zarovich Gate, or "the gate to the lake," because it leads to Lake Zarovich (chapter 2, area L).
	- The west gate is referred to as the Sunset Gate, even though no living person in Vallaki has seen an undimmed sunset. A few abandoned cottages line the road outside this gate.
	- The east gate is also known as the Morning Gate, or, as some locals like to call it, the Mourning Gate.
- Heavy iron chains with iron padlocks keep the gates shut at night
	- During the day, the gates are closed but not typically locked
- Two town [[#Statblocks|wall guards]] stand just inside each gate
	- The guards greet all visitors with suspicion, particularly those who arrive at night
	- If the characters arrive at night, one or more of them must succeed on a DC 20 Charisma (Persuasion) check to convince the guards to unlock the gate and let them enter
- If trouble breaks out at one of the gates, the guards there cry out, "To arms!"
	- Their shouts are echoed across Vallaki, putting the entire town on alert within minutes
	- Vallaki has twenty-four human [[guard|guards]], half of whom are on duty at any given time
		- (six stand watch at the gates, six patrol the walls)
		- The town can also muster a militia of fifty able-bodied human [[#Statblocks|Vallaki Commoners]]

### House Occupants
- If the characters explore a residence other than the burgomaster's mansion, roll a d20 and consult the following table to determine the house's occupant:

|d20|Occupant|
|---|---|
|1-3|None|
|4-5|2d4 [[Swarm of Rats]]|
|6-18|Vallakian townsfolk|
|19-20|Vallakian [[Cultist]]|

- **Rats**: A house infested with rats appears abandoned at first. The rats are servants of Strahd and attack if the characters explore the interior of the house
- **Townsfolk**: A house of Vallakian townsfolk contains 1d4 adults (LG male and female human [[Commoner]]s and 1d8-1 children (LG male and female human noncombatants)
	- Anyone who listens at the door hears chatter from within
	- Townsfolk won't willingly invite strangers into their homes, but they will speak with characters from behind closed doors or while standing in their vestibules
- **Cultists**: A cult haven contains 2d4 Vallakian adults (LE male and female [[Cultist]]s  and one [[Cult Fanatic]] (LE male or female) who leads them in prayer or orchestrates ritual sacrifices
	- These cultists worship devils and consider [[Fiona Wachter|Lady Fiona Wachter]] to be their spiritual leader.

### St Andral's Church (N1)

### Blue Water Inn (N2)

### Burgomaster's Mansion (N3)
in izek's room: "You open the door to a rather Spartan bedroom. There's the bed a chest of drawers and some shelves. Or rather, it would be sparse if it weren't filled with hundreds of handmade dolls. And they all... look... just like... YOU."

### Wachterhaus (N4)

### Arasek Stockyard (N5)

### Coffin Maker's Shop (N6)

### Blinsky Toys (N7)

### Town Square (N8)

### Vistani Camp (N9)

## Scenario If-Thens
- **PCs openly break laws or antagonize [[Vargas Vallakovich|The Baron]] -> The guards will come down hard**
	- people would snitch if they do this in private
	- guilty until proven innocent
- **[[Izek Strazni|Izek]] sees his sibling -> He immediately recognizes them and is so excited, he freaks everyone out**
- **PCs are arrested -> [[Izek Strazni|Izek]] comes around pretty quickly**
	- If a minor ordeal: [[Izek Strazni|Izek]] will use his authority to excuse the party and try to get them to the [[#Burgomaster's Mansion (N3)|Burgomaster's mansion]] where he says they'll be safe
		- gives them a good chance to explore the mansion since they have his permission to be there
	- If not minor: he will do what he must to follow the law and keep his sibling safe
		- he's ok executing another party member that isn't his sibling
	- If the sibling commits terrible crimes: he actively betrays Vallaki
- **[[Fiona Wachter|Fiona]] gets wind of PCs from spies -> she believes one of them is her messiah ([[Pelanil]] since he is a Cleric who believes in the power of light)**
	- She will go ahead and initiate her plan to overthrow [[Vargas Vallakovich|Burgomaster Vallakovich]] at the [[#Festival of the Blazing Sun]]
	- She'll try to convince the party to join her side also by lamenting what a horrible leader [[Vargas Vallakovich|Vargas]] is
- **PCs side with [[Fiona Wachter|Lady Wachter]] and revolution takes place** -> [[Vargas Vallakovich|The Baron]] won't be killed, but taken prisoner, tortured, and paraded around town
	- Roll to see how many guards die in riot (describe them as being lynched by the mob)
	- [[Lydia Petrovna|Lydia]] and [[Victor Vallakovich|Victor]] will be left alone, but will be public outcasts
- **PCs side with [[Vargas Vallakovich|Vargas]]** -> He asks them to find proof of [[Fiona Wachter|Lady Wachter]]'s foul plans
	- If they do, [[Vargas Vallakovich|Vargas]] sends every guard not on gate duty to [[#Wachterhaus (N4)|Wachterhaus]] and drag her to the center of town for public execution
	- They'll be a fight at [[#Wachterhaus (N4)]]
	- The next night after [[Fiona Wachter|Fiona]]'s death, her most loyal cultists will break into the [[#Burgomaster's Mansion (N3)]] and assassinate [[Vargas Vallakovich|Vargas]]
- **The party goes to the [[#Coffin Maker's Shop (N6)|Coffin Shop]] looking for bones** -> [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] is alerted, and shows up within a few hours on [[Beucephalus]]
	- Makes a show of riding through town, and sets his vampire spawn (6 of them) loose on the town and the church (if not consecrated)
	- If [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] is safe, he's pissed
	- If she's not safe, he tries to charm her into coming with him
	- Then, at the [[#Festival of the Blazing Sun]], the public unrest boils over into full blown panic
		- A mob erupts against [[Vargas Vallakovich|The Baron]] and his men (worse than [[Fiona Wachter|Fiona's]] revolution would have been
		- [[Vargas Vallakovich|Vargas]] and [[Lydia Petrovna|Lydia]] are lynched in the middle of town, and the mansion burned down
		- fires spread, and there is city-wide looting
		- roll to see which buildings are destroyed (and in turn which NPCs die) in the chaos
	- When the dust settles, [[Fiona Wachter|Fiona]] takes over as Burgomaster if she's still alive
		- If not, the town remains in state of unrest
			- many will camp around the church, others will take advantage of lack of laws
