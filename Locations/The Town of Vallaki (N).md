aliases: [Vallaki, The Town of Vallaki]

## Laws
- No one shall speak Strahd's name out loud or carry written documents with his name on them
- No one shall speak poorly of the Baron or the festivals nor hold any documents that present either in an ill light
- Everyone shall take part in preparing the festivals
	- The Vallakians treat this sort of like Jury Duty
- Everyone shall attend the festivals
	- Every festival, guards go door to door and patrol the streets to make sure no one is missing out
	- Of course, they can't actually check everywhere, so hiding isn't impossible
	- But getting caught avoiding a festival is grounds for a steep punishment
- Regular laws apply
	- e.g. murdering a civilian would result in incarceration, but murdering a guard would mean execution
 
### Punishments
- Time in stocks between a day to a few weeks
- Seizure of assets
- Imprisonment at Vallaki's Reformation House
- Personal reformation conducted by [[Vargas Vallakovich|The Baron]]
	- He chooses a random dissenter and takes them to his mansion for hands-on torture
- public hanging
	- doesn't happen often, and reserved for severe dissenters that repeat offense

## Locations
### The Gates
>The Old Svalich Road meanders into a valley watched over by dark, brooding mountains to the north and south. The woods recede, revealing a sullen mountain burg surrounded by a wooden palisade. Thick fog presses up against this wall, as though looking for a way inside, hoping to catch the town aslumber.
>
>The dirt road ends at a set of sturdy iron gates with a pair of shadowy figures standing behind them. Planted in the ground and flanking the road outside the gates are a half-dozen pikes with wolves' heads impaled on them.

When approaching:
>One of the figures just inside the gate, yells out "Who goes there?"

Guard names: [[Valentin Ulrich]] and [[Alana Ivanova]]

- A 15-foot-high wall encloses the town, its vertical logs held together with thick ropes and mortar. The top of each log has been sharpened to a point. Wooden scaffolding hugs the inside of the palisade twelve feet off the ground, enabling guards to peer over the wall there

- Three tall gates made of iron bars lead into town:
	- The north gate is sometimes called the Zarovich Gate, or "the gate to the lake," because it leads to Lake Zarovich (chapter 2, area L).
	- The west gate is referred to as the Sunset Gate, even though no living person in Vallaki has seen an undimmed sunset. A few abandoned cottages line the road outside this gate.
	- The east gate is also known as the Morning Gate, or, as some locals like to call it, the Mourning Gate.
- Heavy iron chains with iron padlocks keep the gates shut at night
	- During the day, the gates are closed but not typically locked
- Two town [[#Statblocks|wall guards]] stand just inside each gate
	- The guards greet all visitors with suspicion, particularly those who arrive at night
	- If the characters arrive at night, one or more of them must succeed on a DC 20 Charisma (Persuasion) check to convince the guards to unlock the gate and let them enter
- If trouble breaks out at one of the gates, the guards there cry out, "To arms!"
	- Their shouts are echoed across Vallaki, putting the entire town on alert within minutes
	- Vallaki has twenty-four human [[guard|guards]], half of whom are on duty at any given time
		- (six stand watch at the gates, six patrol the walls)
		- The town can also muster a militia of fifty able-bodied human [[#Statblocks|Vallaki Commoners]]

#### Interrogation
- The point is to make it clear that [[The Town of Vallaki (N)|Vallaki]] takes itself seriously
**Before opening the gates**:
- Who are you (Who goes there)
- What's your business in town?
	- Just looking for anything suspicious
	- If the PCs seem doubtful, have the guards latch onto that doubt and drill them
- (optional) What is your relation to [[Strahd Von Zarovich]]?
	- They want to filter out [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] supporters
- [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]]'s family name is well know, and she can help with any mistakes here
	- She'll happily present herself to the guards
 
**The Laws of Vallaki**:
- Open the gates
- Have the guards give them a rundown of Vallaki law:

>Once inside, the mention of the name "Strahd" is strictly illegal, even in written form. Know that even now as I say the name, it is the last time you will hear it within the gates. Instead, if you must refer to the aforementioned individual, you will refer to him simply as, "The Devil."
>
>This noble town holds a festival each week in honor of the resident's general merriment and continued support of the Burgomaster, Baron Vargas Vallakovich. As guests of Vallaki, you will not be required to aid in the preparation for our festivals. However, your attendance and participation in each and every festival is absolutely mandatory for the length of your stay. Failure to attend will be in strict opposition to Vallakian law. The next great Vallakian festival, the Festival of the Blazing Sun, will be held in three days time in the town square.
>
>Failure to comply with any Vallakian law will mark you as criminals to our city and you will be punished as such in accordance to our justice system. If you have any questions, now is the time to ask them.

- Reinforce these laws as much as necessary
- If asked about:
	- **the festivals**: the guards explain them in the most positive light
	- **punishment**: only the basics; anywhere between a fine, imprisonment, or in severe cases, execution

**Weapons Registry**
- Before letting them into town, the guards ask the party to present their weapons for registry
- For each character, a scribe will write a quick sheet with their description, and name as well as a description of all their gear
- **Fake Name**: DC12 deception
- **Hide Weapon**: slight of hand against guard's passive perception
- If caught, guard will just get annoyed and ask for the truth

**Inside**
- After all this, they let the party in
>This town is absolutely bustling. The streets are teeming with people, far more than you remember seeing in the empty streets of [[Village of Barovia (E)|Barovia Village]]. And some of them even seem to be... smiling. This place almost strikes you as normal. At least compared to the places you've seen thus far in this godforsaken realm.

- The players will probably head west through town from the eastern gate
	- unless they fixate on a specific building, go ahead and skip [[#Arasek Stockyard (N5)]] and [[#Coffin Maker's Shop (N6)]]
	- They'll probably be heading to the [[#Blue Water Inn (N2)]] from a townie's advice, or to [[#St Andral's Church (N1)]] on [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]]'s request
	- They land in [[#Town Square (N8)]]

### House Occupants
- If the characters explore a residence other than the burgomaster's mansion, roll a d20 and consult the following table to determine the house's occupant:

|d20|Occupant|
|---|---|
|1-3|None|
|4-5|2d4 [[Swarm of Rats]]|
|6-18|Vallakian townsfolk|
|19-20|Vallakian [[Cultist]]|

- **Rats**: A house infested with rats appears abandoned at first. The rats are servants of Strahd and attack if the characters explore the interior of the house
- **Townsfolk**: A house of Vallakian townsfolk contains 1d4 adults (LG male and female human [[Commoner]]s and 1d8-1 children (LG male and female human noncombatants)
	- Anyone who listens at the door hears chatter from within
	- Townsfolk won't willingly invite strangers into their homes, but they will speak with characters from behind closed doors or while standing in their vestibules
- **Cultists**: A cult haven contains 2d4 Vallakian adults (LE male and female [[Cultist]]s  and one [[Cult Fanatic]] (LE male or female) who leads them in prayer or orchestrates ritual sacrifices
	- These cultists worship devils and consider [[Fiona Wachter|Lady Fiona Wachter]] to be their spiritual leader.

### St Andral's Church (N1)

### Blue Water Inn (N2)

### Burgomaster's Mansion (N3)
in [[Izek Strazni|Izek]]'s room: "You open the door to a rather Spartan bedroom. There's the bed a chest of drawers and some shelves. Or rather, it would be sparse if it weren't filled with hundreds of handmade dolls. And they all... look... just like... YOU."

### Wachterhaus (N4)

### Arasek Stockyard (N5)

### Coffin Maker's Shop (N6)

### Blinsky Toys (N7)

### Town Square (N8)
>The shops and homes that enclose the town square are decorated with limp, tattered garlands and painted wooden boxes filled with tiny, dead flowers. In the middle of the square is a large wooden platform about four feet tall. This square stage features stocks lined up around the edges and facing outward towards the rest of the town square, locked in which are several men, women, and children wearing crude, plaster donkey heads on full display. In the center of this platform is an empty gallows, a trio of nooses hanging ready and waiting.
>
>Off to the side of the square, peasants in patchwork clothes eye you suspiciously as they use cups and vases to draw water from a crumbling stone fountain. Standing tall at the center of the fountain is a gray statue of an impressive man facing west. Throughout the square, you notice guards like those at the gate patrolling the area. All around the square are posted proclamations:

- [[Old Vallaki Proclamation]]
- Most Vallakians have no idea whom the statue in the square represents. The burgomaster claims it is [[Boris Vallakovich]], his ancestor and the town's founder, but there's no noticeable family resemblance.
- Other stages off to the side for festivals
- **The townsfolk in the stocks**
	- arrested for "malicious unhappiness" (spreading negative opinions about the upcoming festival)
	- An iron padlock secures each set of stocks
	- [[Izek Strazni]] carries the keys on an iron ring
	- Three men, two women, and two boys are trapped in the stocks—all of them tired, wet, and famished
		- The five adults have the statistics of human [[commoner]]
		- the children are noncombatants
		- The plaster donkey heads they wear are meant to encourage ridicule.
	- Freeing one or more prisoners without [[Vargas Vallakovich|The Baron]]'s consent is a crime
		- If the characters try:
			- A townie may first try to stop them, saying they're acting like barbarians and warning of [[Izek Strazni|Izek]]
			- The patrolling guards notice
				- [[Izek Strazni|Izek]] arrives quickly with 24 town [[guard]]s (twenty-four in all) and orders the characters to stop what they're doing
				- If [[Izek Strazni|Izek]]'s sibling is present, he notices and takes the party to come back to the [[#Burgomaster's Mansion (N3)]]
				- The party may be punished for their crimes depending on the severity
- **Townies**:
	- [[Danya Karushkin]] glares at them and tells them to get lost
	- [[Isabella 

If the characters are exiled from Vallaki without their weapons, the Keepers of the Feather (see [area N2](http://longo.com.br/5e/adventure.html#cos,5,n2.%20blue%20water%20inn)) snatch the party's belongings from under Izek's nose and see them safely returned to the characters.

If the guards fail to waylay the characters, Izek (if he's still around) flees to the burgomaster's mansion, giving the characters the run of the town. The townsfolk lock themselves in their homes, fearful that the characters aim to murder them.



### Vistani Camp (N9)

## Scenario If-Thens
- **PCs openly break laws or antagonize [[Vargas Vallakovich|The Baron]] -> The guards will come down hard**
	- people would snitch if they do this in private
	- guilty until proven innocent
- **[[Izek Strazni|Izek]] sees his sibling -> He immediately recognizes them and is so excited, he freaks everyone out**
- **PCs are arrested -> [[Izek Strazni|Izek]] comes around pretty quickly**
	- If a minor ordeal: [[Izek Strazni|Izek]] will use his authority to excuse the party and try to get them to the [[#Burgomaster's Mansion (N3)|Burgomaster's mansion]] where he says they'll be safe
		- gives them a good chance to explore the mansion since they have his permission to be there
	- If not minor: he will do what he must to follow the law and keep his sibling safe
		- he's ok executing another party member that isn't his sibling
	- If the sibling commits terrible crimes: he actively betrays Vallaki
- **[[Fiona Wachter|Fiona]] gets wind of PCs from spies -> she believes one of them is her messiah ([[Pelanil]] since he is a Cleric who believes in the power of light)**
	- She will go ahead and initiate her plan to overthrow [[Vargas Vallakovich|Burgomaster Vallakovich]] at the [[#Festival of the Blazing Sun]]
	- She'll try to convince the party to join her side also by lamenting what a horrible leader [[Vargas Vallakovich|Vargas]] is
- **PCs side with [[Fiona Wachter|Lady Wachter]] and revolution takes place** -> [[Vargas Vallakovich|The Baron]] won't be killed, but taken prisoner, tortured, and paraded around town
	- Roll to see how many guards die in riot (describe them as being lynched by the mob)
	- [[Lydia Petrovna|Lydia]] and [[Victor Vallakovich|Victor]] will be left alone, but will be public outcasts
- **PCs side with [[Vargas Vallakovich|Vargas]]** -> He asks them to find proof of [[Fiona Wachter|Lady Wachter]]'s foul plans
	- If they do, [[Vargas Vallakovich|Vargas]] sends every guard not on gate duty to [[#Wachterhaus (N4)|Wachterhaus]] and drag her to the center of town for public execution
	- They'll be a fight at [[#Wachterhaus (N4)]]
	- The next night after [[Fiona Wachter|Fiona]]'s death, her most loyal cultists will break into the [[#Burgomaster's Mansion (N3)]] and assassinate [[Vargas Vallakovich|Vargas]]
- **The party goes to the [[#Coffin Maker's Shop (N6)|Coffin Shop]] looking for bones** -> [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] is alerted, and shows up within a few hours on [[Beucephalus]]
	- Makes a show of riding through town, and sets his vampire spawn (6 of them) loose on the town and the church (if not consecrated)
	- If [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] is safe, he's pissed
	- If she's not safe, he tries to charm her into coming with him
	- Then, at the [[#Festival of the Blazing Sun]], the public unrest boils over into full blown panic
		- A mob erupts against [[Vargas Vallakovich|The Baron]] and his men (worse than [[Fiona Wachter|Fiona's]] revolution would have been
		- [[Vargas Vallakovich|Vargas]] and [[Lydia Petrovna|Lydia]] are lynched in the middle of town, and the mansion burned down
		- fires spread, and there is city-wide looting
		- roll to see which buildings are destroyed (and in turn which NPCs die) in the chaos
		- If the festival has already taken place: [[Vargas Vallakovich|Vargas]] calls a public meeting, and shit goes down there
		- If [[Vargas Vallakovich|Vargas]] is no longer in charge, [[Fiona Wachter|Fiona]] calls a meeting and explains that "Strahd's coming was all part of her prophesied purge and that sunlight would come soon."
	
	- When the dust settles, [[Fiona Wachter|Fiona]] takes over as Burgomaster if she's still alive
		- If not, the town remains in state of unrest
			- many will camp around the church, others will take advantage of lack of laws
 
## Battles in Vallaki
- If a guard is killed, it's grounds for execution
	- Give the guards backstories
- The guards fight intelligently
	- try their best to separate get PCs alone
	- retreat and come back when party isn't expecting them
		- e.g. middle of night
- depending on severity, arrested PCs will
	- be put in stocks
	- taken to the [[Reformation Center]]
	- or lined up for execution by hanging in public square
- if PC evades capture, they become wanted
	- bounty hunters may come looking on the road to [[Village of Krezk (S)|Krezk]]
