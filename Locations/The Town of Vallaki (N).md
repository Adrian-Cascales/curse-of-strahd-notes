## Laws
- No one shall speak Strahd's name out loud or carry written documents with his name on them
- No one shall speak poorly of the Baron or the festivals nor hold any documents that present either in an ill light
- Everyone shall take part in preparing the festivals
	- The Vallakians treat this sort of like Jury Duty
- Everyone shall attend the festivals
	- Every festival, guards go door to door and patrol the streets to make sure no one is missing out
	- Of course, they can't actually check everywhere, so hiding isn't impossible
	- But getting caught avoiding a festival is grounds for a steep punishment
- Regular laws apply
	- e.g. murdering a civilian would result in incarceration, but murdering a guard would mean execution
 
### Punishments
- Time in stocks between a day to a few weeks
- Seizure of assets
- Imprisonment at Vallaki's Reformation House
- Personal reformation conducted by [[Vargas Vallakovich|The Baron]]
	- He chooses a random dissenter and takes them to his mansion for hands-on torture
- public hanging
	- doesn't happen often, and reserved for severe dissenters that repeat offense
