# Curse of Strahd Notes

Hi friends! This [repo](https://github.com/cnorick/curse-of-strahd-notes) contains my entire Obsidian vault for our Curse of Strahd campaign. These notes can be viewed as a website at <https://cos.nathanorick.com>.

## Who is This For

While I don't expect anyone besides my players and me to get much out of the content of the notes, I made this repo public so that other Dungeon Masters could take advantage of the structure of the notes and fill in their own information while running the campaign.

## How Do I Get It

If you want to use this for yourself, just fork the repo and download a copy of the vault. You'll find that there are already notes created for most characters, locations, or items in the Curse of Strahd 5e campaign. The actual content of those notes is a combination of content directly from the book, from the [MandyMod Fleshing Out Curse of Strahd Series on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/CurseofStrahd/comments/9pbka6/fleshing_out_curse_of_strahd_master_table_of/), other online sources, and my own modifications.

Also note that this campaign is ongoing and so there may still be some blank entries in the Obsidian vault.

## How Do I Turn It Into a Website

For those with the technical prowess, there are also a couple scripts included that turn this set of notes into two separate websites: One for me (and you), and one for sharing no-spoiler versions of the notes with my players. I use the plugin [Obsidian Webpage Export](https://github.com/KosmosisDire/obsidian-webpage-export) to export the entire vault as a site. Then, I run the python code found in the Website/scripts folder to copy the pages, and then modify each one to remove any spoilers for my players.

## Enjoy

This has been been especially handy in publishing session notes and handouts for players to see on their phones.
