## Playing Lydia Petrovna
- At the risk of sacrificing her sanity, she has embraced her husband's philosophy of happiness
	- She laughs at [[Vargas Vallokovich|The Baron]]'s every comment, to the extent that it has become a nervous reflex
	- she tries to spread good cheer by throwing daily tea-and-sandwich parties in the parlor for her "dearest friends," many of them poor folk who tolerate the baroness only because they crave something warm to eat and drink
- Lydia is a gods-fearing woman and the younger sister of the town priest, [[Father Lucian Petrovich]]. She is a descendant of Tasha Petrovna, a priest entombed in Castle Ravenloft (chapter 4,Â [area K84](http://longo.com.br/5e/adventure.html#CoS,4,k84.%20catacombs), crypt 11)
