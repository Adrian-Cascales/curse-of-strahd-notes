## History/Info
- Morgantha gave her coven's [[Hag Eye]] to [[Cyrus Belview]]
	- so she can keep an eye on [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]]
- She's fearful of [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]], and respects his dominion over this land

## Playing Morgantha/Granny
### As Granny Selling Dream Pies
- Most loving grandmotherly person in the world
	- kind to a fault and a shameless gossip
- Have her tell round-about-truths instead of outright lies
	- in case players insight check her, there's nothing to hide
- If players ask for her name: "Why it's Morgantha, dear. But everyone just calls me Granny. Morgantha is much to formal"
- If players check her and sense she's a fiend:
	- She sees a look on their face and asks what's wrong.
	- If prodded:
		- Tell horrible story about how mother had a nasty encounter with a witch that left its stain on the whole family (technically true)
		- hidden truth: Morgantha devoured her mother when she was younger
- Knows a little about everyone in the village
	- because she has to keep track of her clients

## What They Know
[[Barovian Lore]]
- [[Strahd Von Zarovich]] has mastery over the land and the weather, and his spies include the [[Vistani]]
- There's a [[Vistani]] camp to the west, on the shores of [[Tser Pool]] on the outskirts of [[The Town of Vallaki (N)]]
- [[Strahd Von Zarovich]] has undead enemies in Barovia, namely the fallen knights of the [[Order of the Silver Dragon]]. These revenants can be found in a ruined mansion west of [[The Town of Vallaki (N)]] (see [[Argynvostholt]])
- [[Strahd Von Zarovich]]'s most carefully guarded secret is a temple of forbidden lore hidden in the mountains (see [[Amber Temple]]). The temple can be reached by following the long and winding [[Tsolenka Pass]]

### Rumors About the [[Village of Barovia (E)]]
- No one has seen the burgomaster for a few days and his children aren't saying much
- The rumor is The Burgomaster's daughter, [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] has caught [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]]'s eye recently
	- The townsfolk are afraid to interfere

## At Old Bonegrinder
- Morgantha can use the barrel as a font for a [scrying](http://longo.com.br/5e/spells.html#scrying_phb) spell. She can also knock on the barrel three times as an action to summon a [dretch](http://longo.com.br/5e/bestiary.html#dretch_mm). The demon crawls out of the barrel at the end of Morgantha's turn and obeys the night hag's commands for 1 hour, after which it dissolves into a pool of ichor. Morgantha can summon up to nine dretches in this manner before the ichor is gone.

## Relations

traits:
  - name: Innate Spellcasting
    desc: >-
      The hag's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 14, +6 to
      hit with spell attacks). She can innately cast the following spells,
      requiring no material components:


      At will: detect magic, magic missile

      2/day each: plane shift (self only), ray of enfeeblement, sleep
    attack_bonus: 0
  - name: Magic Resistance
    desc: The hag has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical
      effects.
    attack_bonus: 0
  - name: Night Hag Items
    desc: >-
      A night hag carries two very rare magic items that she must craft for
      herself If either object is lost, the night hag will go to great lengths
      to retrieve it, as creating a new tool takes time and effort.

      Heartstone: This lustrous black gem allows a night hag to become ethereal while it is in her possession. The touch of a heartstone also cures any disease. Crafting a heartstone takes 30 days.

      Soul Bag: When an evil humanoid dies as a result of a night hag's Nightmare Haunting, the hag catches the soul in this black sack made of stitched flesh. A soul bag can hold only one evil soul at a time, and only the night hag who crafted the bag can catch a soul with it. Crafting a soul bag takes 7 days and a humanoid sacrifice (whose flesh is used to make the bag).
    attack_bonus: 0
  - name: Hag Coven
    desc: >-
      When hags must work together, they form covens, in spite of their selfish
      natures. A coven is made up of hags of any type, all of whom are equals
      within the group. However, each of the hags continues to desire more
      personal power.

      A coven consists of three hags so that any arguments between two hags can be settled by the third. If more than three hags ever come together, as might happen if two covens come into conflict, the result is usually chaos.
    attack_bonus: 0
  - name: Shared Spellcasting (Coven Only)
    desc: >-
      While all three members of a hag coven are within 30 feet of one another,
      they can each cast the following spells from the wizard's spell list but
      must share the spell slots among themselves:


      • 1st level (4 slots): identify, ray of sickness

      • 2nd level (3 slots): hold person, locate object

      • 3rd level (3 slots): bestow curse, counterspell, lightning bolt

      • 4th level (3 slots): phantasmal killer, polymorph

      • 5th level (2 slots): contact other plane, scrying

      • 6th level (1 slot): eye bite


      For casting these spells, each hag is a 12th-level spellcaster that uses Intelligence as her spellcasting ability. The spell save DC is 12+the hag's Intelligence modifier, and the spell attack bonus is 4+the hag's Intelligence modifier.
    attack_bonus: 0
  - name: Hag Eye (Coven Only)
    desc: >-
      A hag coven can craft a magic item called a hag eye, which is made from a
      real eye coated in varnish and often fitted to a pendant or other wearable
      item. The hag eye is usually entrusted to a minion for safekeeping and
      transport. A hag in the coven can take an action to see what the hag eye
      sees if the hag eye is on the same plane of existence. A hag eye has AC
      10, 1 hit point, and darkvision with a radius of 60 feet. If it is
      destroyed, each coven member takes 3d10 psychic damage and is blinded for
      24 hours.

      A hag coven can have only one hag eye at a time, and creating a new one requires all three members of the coven to perform a ritual. The ritual takes 1 hour, and the hags can't perform it while blinded. During the ritual, if the hags take any action other than performing the ritual, they must start over.

actions:
  - name: Claws (Hag Form Only)
    desc: "Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d8 +
      4) slashing damage."
    attack_bonus: 7
    damage_dice: 2d8
    damage_bonus: 4
  - name: Change Shape
    desc: The hag magically polymorphs into a Small or Medium female humanoid, or
      back into her true form. Her statistics are the same in each form. Any
      equipment she is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. She reverts to her
      true form if she dies.
    attack_bonus: 0
  - name: Etherealness
    desc: The hag magically enters the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, or
      vice versa. To do so, the hag must have a heartstone in her possession.
    attack_bonus: 0
  - name: Nightmare Haunting (1/Day)
    desc: While on the Ethereal Plane, the hag magically touches a sleeping humanoid
      on the Material Plane. A protection from evil and good spell cast on the
      target prevents this contact, as does a magic circle. As long as the
      contact persists, the target has dreadful visions. If these visions last
      for at least 1 hour, the target gains no benefit from its rest, and its
      hit point maximum is reduced by 5 (1d10). If this effect reduces the
      target's hit point maximum to 0, the target dies, and if the target was
      evil, its soul is trapped in the hag's soul bag. The reduction to the
      target's hit point maximum lasts until removed by the greater restoration
      spell or similar magic.
