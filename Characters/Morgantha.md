## Playing Morgantha/Granny
### As Granny Selling Dream Pies
- Most loving grandmotherly person in the world
	- kind to a fault and a shameless gossip
- Have her tell round-about-truths instead of outright lies
	- in case players insight check her, there's nothing to hide
- If players ask for her name: "Why it's Morgantha, dear. But everyone just calls me Granny. Morgantha is much to formal"
- If players check her and sense she's a feind:
	- She sees a look on their face and asks what's wrong.
	- If prodded:
		- Tell horrible story about how mother had a nasty encounter with a witch that left its stain on the whole family (technically true)
		- hidden truth: Morgantha devoured her mother when she was younger
- Knows a little about everyone in the village
	- because she has to keep track of her clients
