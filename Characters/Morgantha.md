## History/Info
- Morgantha gave her coven's [[Hag Eye]] to [[Cyrus Belview]]
	- so she can keep an eye on [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]]
- She's fearful of [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]], and respects his dominion over this land
## Playing Morgantha/Granny
### As Granny Selling Dream Pies
- Most loving grandmotherly person in the world
	- kind to a fault and a shameless gossip
- Have her tell round-about-truths instead of outright lies
	- in case players insight check her, there's nothing to hide
- If players ask for her name: "Why it's Morgantha, dear. But everyone just calls me Granny. Morgantha is much to formal"
- If players check her and sense she's a fiend:
	- She sees a look on their face and asks what's wrong.
	- If prodded:
		- Tell horrible story about how mother had a nasty encounter with a witch that left its stain on the whole family (technically true)
		- hidden truth: Morgantha devoured her mother when she was younger
- Knows a little about everyone in the village
	- because she has to keep track of her clients

## What They Know
[[Barovian Lore]]
- [[Strahd Von Zarovich]] has mastery over the land and the weather, and his spies include the [[Vistani]]
- There's a [[Vistani]] camp to the west, on the shores of [[Tser Pool]] on the outskirts of [[The Town of Vallaki (N)]]
- [[Strahd Von Zarovich]] has undead enemies in Barovia, namely the fallen knights of the [[Order of the Silver Dragon]]. These revenants can be found in a ruined mansion west of [[The Town of Vallaki (N)]] (see [[Argynvostholt]])
- [[Strahd Von Zarovich]]'s most carefully guarded secret is a temple of forbidden lore hidden in the mountains (see [[Amber Temple]]). The temple can be reached by following the long and winding [[Tsolenka Pass]]

### Rumors About the [[Village of Barovia (E)]]
- No one has seen the burgomaster for a few days and his children aren't saying much
- The rumor is The Burgomaster's daughter, [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] has caught [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]]'s eye recently
	- The townsfolk are afraid to interfere

## At Old Bonegrinder
- Morgantha can use the barrel as a font for a [scrying](http://longo.com.br/5e/spells.html#scrying_phb) spell. She can also knock on the barrel three times as an action to summon a [dretch](http://longo.com.br/5e/bestiary.html#dretch_mm). The demon crawls out of the barrel at the end of Morgantha's turn and obeys the night hag's commands for 1 hour, after which it dissolves into a pool of ichor. Morgantha can summon up to nine dretches in this manner before the ichor is gone.

## Relations
