## History/Info

## What They Want
- During his stay at [[The Town of Vallaki (N)#Blue Water Inn (N2)|The Blue Water Inn]], he is quietly gathering information on the [[The Keepers of the Feather]]], trying to figure out the identities of all the wereravens in town. He's also trying to learn as much as he can about the Vistani, particularly the ones living in the camp just outside town ([area N9](http://longo.com.br/5e/adventure.html#cos,5,n9.%20vistani%20camp)). Once he concludes that they are in league with Strahd, [Rictavio](http://longo.com.br/5e/bestiary.html#rictavio_cos) plans to unleash his trained saber-toothed tiger upon them, with or without the support of the wereravens.

[Rictavio](http://longo.com.br/5e/bestiary.html#rictavio_cos) wears a [hat of disguise](http://longo.com.br/5e/items.html#hat%20of%20disguise_dmg) and a [ring of mind shielding](http://longo.com.br/5e/items.html#ring%20of%20mind%20shielding_dmg) to conceal his identity. He carries an iron key that unlocks the door to his carnival wagon ([area N5](http://longo.com.br/5e/adventure.html#cos,5,n5.%20arasek%20stockyard)).
