alias: Ireena
---
(LG female human noble)
## Playing Ireena Kolyana
- a striking young woman with auburn hair
- she's been bitten twice by [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]]
	- because of this: the villagers are afraid of her and avoid her
- She appears mild
	- but has a strong will, and she aids the party as best she can in saving herself
	- has a stubborn streak and sometimes will plant herself and changing her mind becomes extraordinarily difficult
- She is one of the few truly good people in the game
	- She's scared like everyone else, but her fear has made her kind and empathetic
	- She doesn't let her fear of [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] stand in her way
		- She actively works to avoid him
		- The fear motivates her
	- She comforts children, helps those in need
- loves discovering new things
- Has a sense of humor and will sometimes crack jokes (unusual in Barovia) {It's a lingering effect of [[Tatyana]]'s soul from an earlier time}
- As a noble, she shines at persuasion, deception, and insight
	- She's the only daughter of the Burgomaster and part of only three noble families
	- Give her the *Position of Privilege* feature from the noble background
		- All the commoners will bend over backwards to accommodate her if they know who she is
		- Always one level better than normal for *Attitude* (friendly, hostile, etc.)
- Being politically savvy, can help the party navigate the political mess in [[Vallaki]]
	- can execute a political scandal or disgrace individuals
- Does embroidery as it is an "appropriate hobby for a lady"
	- All her cloth items (clothes, backpack, etc.) have flourishes
	- She's really good with the needle {given time to learn, she can pick up the basics of medical care/herbalism}
		- {mechanically, let her unlock the *Healer* feat + the ability to make *Healer Kits*}
			- Not good enough to do it during combat though
- She tries to be helpful to the party and not stand in the way
	- the most actively helpful individual the party will encounter
	- when she can't keep up in a fight, she'll do other things:
		- gather expended ammo, teaching herself first aid, searching bodies for useful stuff, etc.
- She's not used to the rigors of life on the move -- especially the pace set by PCs
	- Her feet will hurt at first. She may show signs and will be grateful for kindness/help
		- But will absolutely not complain; she's good at sucking it up
- Her hair is auburn (brownish red) and is unheard of in Barovia.
	- She dies her hair black, because "red hair is unlucky"
		- {this throws off her relationship to [[Tatyana]]}
		- {all of [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]]' s targets have that color hair and they have died (unlucky)}
		- She has to re-dye it regularly or stand out in the crowd
- She's really pretty with high Cha and [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] is jealous; if an NPC flirts to hard, they may wind up dead

## What They Want
- She wants the characters to bury her father 
	- She refuses to go anywhere "while the burgomaster lies dead on the mansion floor"
- The PCs are her best hope at protection
	- so she's willing to accompany them if they bury her father

## What They Know
[[Barovian Lore]]
- She doesn't remember her early past
- She doesn't know how she came to Barovia or where she came from
- [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] takes consorts on occasion
	- Doesn't know why She is special to [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]]
- Her encounters with [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] are fuzzy memories (because of his vampiric charm)
	- She remembers the blazing hunger in his eyes
- Wolves and creatures attacked the house night after night for weeks
	- The burgomaster's heart couldn't stand the constant assault
		- he died 3 days ago
		- since then, there have been no more attacks
- No one from the village has been brave enough to help [[Ismark Kolyanovich]] take [[Koylan Indirovich]] to the cemetery for a proper burial
- One of the best educated in the valley, as the Burgomaster's daughter
	- familiar with the geography (have her give them the map maybe)
	- can provide info about important people in each town
	- can regurgitate Barovia history trivia without a check

## Secrets
- She is the blood sister of [[Izek Strazni]], but neither of them know it

## Notes
- [[If Players Die]], an option would be to let them play Ireena since she will follow the group most of the game
	- For ambitious players, I can hand her over to play as well as their own character
- You could consider not making her Izek's sister, but instead one of the PCs
- After she joins the party, consider bumping up her stats only gradually ([source](https://www.reddit.com/r/CurseofStrahd/comments/8vsw2p/my_notes_on_running_ireena_without_making_her_a/))
	- after asking the PCs to train her
	- PCs always out class her
	- She is better at defending herself from mundane threats

## Relations
adopted brother: [[Ismark Kolyanovich]]
father: [[Koylan Indirovich]]
