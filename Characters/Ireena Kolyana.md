alias: Ireena
---
(LG female human noble)
## Playing Ireena Kolyana
- a striking young woman with auburn hair
- she's been bitten twice by [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]]
	- because of this: the villagers are afraid of her and avoid her
- She appears mild
	- but has a strong will, and she aids the party as best she can in saving herself
- She is one of the few truly good people in the game
- has a stubborn streak
- loves discovering new things
- honestly wants to help those in need
- She doesn't let her fear of [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] stand in her way
	- She actively works to avoid him
- As a noble, she shines at persuasion, deception, and insight
	- She's the only daughter of the Burgomaster and part of only three noble families
	- Give her the *Position of Privilege* feature from the noble background

## What They Want
- She wants the characters to bury her father 
	- She refuses to go anywhere "while the burgomaster lies dead on the mansion floor"
- The PCs are her best hope at protection
	- so she's willing to accompany them if they bury her father

## What They Know
[[Barovian Lore]]
- She doesn't remember her early past
- She doesn't know how she came to Barovia or where she came from
- [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] takes consorts on occasion
	- Doesn't know why She is special to [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]]
- Her encounters with [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] are fuzzy memories (because of his vampiric charm)
	- She remembers the blazing hunger in his eyes
- Wolves and creatures attacked the house night after night for weeks
	- The burgomaster's heart couldn't stand the constant assault
		- he died 3 days ago
		- since then, there have been no more attacks
- No one from the village has been brave enough to help [[Ismark Kolyanovich]] take [[Koylan Indirovich]] to the cemetery for a proper burial

## Secrets
- She is the blood sister of [[Izek Strazni]], but neither of them know it

## Notes
- [[If Players Die]], an option would be to let them play Ireena since she will follow the group most of the game
	- For ambitious players, I can hand her over to play as well as their own character
- You could consider not making her Izek's sister, but instead one of the PCs
- After she joins the party, consider bumping up her stats only gradually ([source](https://www.reddit.com/r/CurseofStrahd/comments/8vsw2p/my_notes_on_running_ireena_without_making_her_a/))
	- after asking the PCs to train her
	- PCs always out class her
	- She is better at defending herself from mundane threats

adopted brother: [[Ismark Kolyanovich]]
father: [[Koylan Indirovich]]
