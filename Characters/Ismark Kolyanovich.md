(LG male human veteran)
- Other villagers call him "Ismark the Lesser" because he has lived in the shadow of his father

## Playing Ismark Kolyanovich
- He's not the typically dour Barovian
	- He's friendly and personal when you talk to him about [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] or [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]]
	- But he's pretty tight-lipped when talking about anything else
		- Unless you're able to befriend him
- He's spent most of his adult life training with weapons in the hope of one day killing [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]]
- Honest to a fault
- Kind, but seems perpetually exhausted
- He's desperate when we first meet him
	- {His father has died and his sister is being}

## What They Want
- He wants his sister to be safe from Strahd
	- Beyond that, he wants Strahd dead

## Notes
- Try to avoid having him join the party. Combat becomes a bit tedious with him and Ireena.
	- But if the party insists, we can work it out
	- The book says he agrees to go if the party takes Ireena to somewhere safe first

## What They Know
[[Barovian Lore]]
- For some reason, [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] is attracted to [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] and desires her above all others
- [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] is vulnerable outside of their house
- If the party shows him their letter from the hook, he knows it's not his father's handwriting

## Relations
- Father: [[Koylan Indirovich]]
- Adopted Sister: [[Ireena Kolyana]]
