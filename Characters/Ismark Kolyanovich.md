(LG male human veteran)
- Other villagers call him "Ismark the Lesser" because he has lived in the shadow of his father

## Playing Ismark Kolyanovich
- He's not the typically dour Barovian
	- He's friendly and personal when you talk to him about [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] or [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]]
	- But he's pretty tight-lipped when talking about anything else
		- Unless you're able to befriend him
- He's spent most of his adult life training with weapons in the hope of one day killing [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]]

## Notes
- Try to avoid having him join the party. Combat becomes a bit tedious with him and Ireena.
