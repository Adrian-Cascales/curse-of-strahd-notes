## Playing Gertruda
- She's a teenager (19)
- {She's actually at [[Castle Ravenloft (K)|Ravenloft]] with [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]]}

## History/Info
- Gertruda is oblivious to any danger to herselfâ€”especially from Strahd, who has charmed her
- Sheltered by her mother, she was never allowed to leave home as a child
- She finally slipped away and made her way to the castle, drawn by its majesty

- Gertruda is innocent, and years spent as a shut-in have twisted her sense of reality
- Consequently, she maintains a fairy-tale view of life
- When faced with a decision, she almost always makes the most simplistic choice
- She is naive to the point of being a danger to herself and others
- Fortunately for her, Strahd has not yet bitten her, though he intends to. (If he can do so while the characters look on helplessly, so much the better.)
