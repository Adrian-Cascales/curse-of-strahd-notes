## Laying the Family to Rest
- Once they defeat the monster, they'll be able to take the corpses ([[Walter]], [[Rosevalda|Rose]], [[Thornboldt|Thorn]], and [[Margaret]]) and lay them to rest
- The tomb where they found the little coffin now magically has a coffin, and the stone has [[Margaret]]'s name on it
- Once all the bones they collected (doesn't matter if they get all of them) have been laid to rest, give them inspiration

>You're all suddenly struck by a vision. You see [[Rosevalda|Rose]] and [[Thornboldt|Thorn]] playing in their room. They're alive. The house is clean, well-kept. A young woman walks in. She must be no older than 25, and she's incredibly pretty. You recognize her. It's [[Margaret]]. She's carrying a play tea set -- although, you can't tell its a play set; it seems incredibly expensive. The children cheer as she sits in the floor with them for a tea party.
>
>Flash forward, and you see [[Margaret]] in the kitchen, preparing the children's meals. She giggles as [[Gustav Durst|Mr. Durst]] jokes with her. [[Elizabeth Durst|Elizabeth]] scowls behind a coffee cup in the corner of the room.
>
>Another flash, and you see [[Margaret]] on her bed, in labor. She's accompanied only by one of the other servants, who stands quietly by, holding her hand. Then, you see [[Margaret]] holding a newly-born baby [[Walter]]. She whispers to him, "You look just like your father", as she breaks into quiet sobs.
>
>Then another flash. [[Elizabeth Durst|Mrs. Durst]], looks sorrowfully at herself in the mirror. You can hear [[Margaret]]'s screams in the distance as she's giving birth. "Where has your youth gone?", she whispers to her reflection. "If only you were younger. Maybe then, his eyes wouldn't betray his contempt when he looks at you."
>
>We then see [[Elizabeth Durst|Mrs. Durst]] in the library, furiously and restlessly reading. Just reading. She sits one book down to pick up another. You actually recognize it. It's one of the books you saw in the secret room behind the bookshelf. It's a book of dark magic. She flips to a page that has been bookmarked. The heading reads, "The Path to Immortality".
>
>Flash. [[Margaret]] is wailing. She's begging. "Please. Please. Mrs. Durst. Not Walter. Anything but Walter. Take me. Mrs. Durst. Take me!"
>
>Now, in the middle of altar, surrounded by what's left of her dwindling cult, [[Gustav Durst|Mr. Durst]] nowhere to be found. She lays baby [[Walter]] on the dais. She says the required words. She pulls out a knife. She completes the ritual.
>
>A black cloud engulfs the room. The cultists try to run, but they're swallowed up. [[Elizabeth Durst|Mrs. Durst]] falls to her knees, trembling. The [[Dark Powers]] have given to her the un-aging body she so desired, but she can't help but consider its cost as the inevitable full corruption of her mind is realized.
>
>Flash once more, and you're in the Main Hall of the house. It's filthy, covered in cobwebs and dust. Before you stands a spectral [[Rosevalda|Rose]] holding a sleeping baby [[Walter]]. By her side, [[Thornboldt|Thorn]] cradles his doll, and for the first time, seems unfearful. Behind [[Rosevalda|Rose]] stands a young, transparent [[Margaret]], her hand rested on [[Rosevalda|Rose]]'s shoulder.
>
>[[Rosevalda|Rose]] looks up at you and says "Thank you for saving or baby brother". [[Margaret]] raises her hand in a grateful wave, as the group fades from your sight.
>
>You now find yourselves in the Main Hall of the house.
