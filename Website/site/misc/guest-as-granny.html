She's kind to a fault and a shameless gossip (as many elder women can be as a stereotype).</p></div><div><p>Morgantha introduces herself as Granny, If asked for her name, Morgantha replies honestly, but shows distaste for it. She says:</p></div><div><blockquote>
<p>Why it's Morgantha, dear. But everyone just calls me Granny. Morgantha is much too formal!</p>
</blockquote></div><div><p>Granny sells pastries and pies for 1 Gold each.</p></div><div><p>If the players ask why her wares are so expensive she tells the PCs that it's a bit of magic her mother taught her.</p></div><div><p>The pies bring the eaters only the sweetest dreams, something poorly lacking in this dreary world. She is visibly upset when she says this, honestly seeming grief stricken at the sorry state of the world.</p></div><div><p>Granny's pastries are made from a variety of ingredients, meat pie, onion pie, pumpkin pie etc (this is what Granny has, not what you should make ;-)</p></div><div><p>If players ask what kind of meat is in the pies. Morgantha says something like:</p></div><div><blockquote>
<p>Oh, Barovians use all kinds of meat. Especially since we've a dreadful lack of sunlight for good fruits and veggies. I myself prefer chicken, but there's also goat, deer, pig, and wolf meat depending on where you go. You'd think wolf meat would be more of delicacy, huh? Not here, dearie! With Lord Strahd in charge there's more wolves in these woods than we know what to do with!</p>
