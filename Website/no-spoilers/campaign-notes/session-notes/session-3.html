Once she unlocks the door, the party uncovers a heartbreaking reality: <b>Rose</b> and <b>Thorn</b>'s skeletons are lying in the middle of the bedroom floor, apparently starved to death after being unable to escape their locked room.</p></div><div><p><b>Pelanil</b>, feeling sorrowful for the children, packs up their bones, intent to give them a proper burial. After filling his pack, the ghosts of the two children appear. This time, they are see-through and spectral, obviously ghosts.</p></div><div><p>Seeing that <b>Pelanil</b> is at a loss for words given his grief, <b>Rose</b> speaks up to assure him that they know they're ghosts and they're actually ok with it. The party talks to the children's ghosts who explain that their parents usually locked them away when they went to the basement to deal with the monster, but that the last time, no one came back for them, no matter how much they cried.</p></div><div><p>They ask the party for help. The last time their mom went to the basement, she took their baby brother <b>Walter</b>. They ask the players to help save <b>Walter</b> and help their parents defeat the monster once and for all.</p></div><div><p>The party agrees to help. When they ask where the basement is, <b>Rose</b> points to a dollhouse in the corner of the room. From this dollhouse, the party learns all the secrets to the house, including a secret doorway in the storage room. Before heading to the basement, the party levels up, takes a long rest, and scours the rest of the house for missed loot (they can see where it is from the replica dollhouse). Notably, <b>Pelanil</b> finds a very expensive-looking platinum necklace with a topaz pendant.</p></div><div><p>Rested up, the party makes their way to the storage room, the kids choosing to stay behind. <b>Elora</b> finds a chest with the bones of who <b>Shalooti</b> realizes is Margaret, the nanny. She seems to have been stabbed to death. <b>Pelanil</b> also scoops up these bones to take with him.</p></div><div><h3 data-heading="Into the Dungeon" id="Into_the_Dungeon"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg class="svg-icon right-triangle" fill="none" height="24" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewbox="0 0 24 24" width="24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Into the Dungeon</h3></div><div><p>The party opens the secret door and descends deep into the basement. They're greeted at the bottom of the stairs by a dark, earthen corridor and an incessant chanting, that they can't seem to pinpoint.</p></div><div><p>The party discovers some empty tombs, one with <b>Walter</b>'s name on the door, and the other contains little coffins with their names on them.</p></div><div><h3 data-heading="Cultist Quarters" id="Cultist_Quarters"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg class="svg-icon right-triangle" fill="none" height="24" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewbox="0 0 24 24" width="24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Cultist Quarters</h3></div><div><p>The party makes their way into what seems to be a living space with a wooden table and multiple straw beds.
