		- "My son, I have gone to great lengths to protect you from Menigal's reach. Go forth and kick ass"
- The group finishes dinner
	- will be escorted to their rooms by [[Cyrus Belview|Cyrus]] if they decide to stay
	- if they decide to leave, [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] says the carriage will take them wherever they would like to go in Barovia

		>  So dreadful a creature is Rahadin that anyone who stands within 10 feet of him can hear the howling screams of the countless men and women he has killed in his lifetime. Rahadin can't hear them, nor would he be haunted by them if he could. The only thing he cares about is Strahd von Zarovich, for whom he would gladly give his life.

>Elora, you intrigue me. Unlike the others, you do not shy away from the darkness, but rather seek to understand it. That is a rare quality, one I respect deeply. You are not like the others. You see beyond the veil of fear that blinds them. You seek knowledge, truth... perhaps even power. I could help you find all three.
