**On the city beyond the mists at Yester Hill:**

A long-ago place. The city of my childhood. It is not so near as it would seem. The mists have a way of bringing the past into the present.

**On the Vistani:**

My glorious, beloved itinerants. So much of the flavour of Barovia, wouldnâ€™t you say? The scent of their spices, the strum of their stringed instruments. I am forever indebted to them, and they therefore have privileges unafforded to my other subjects. They saved my life once. True. Long ago, such a thing was still possible.

**On Yester Hill:**

I am a god to many, and not only those who cover themselves in the trappings of civilisation. There is a purity to the forest folk, borne out of their allegiance to the old gods, now finding a home in their worship of me as their lord and master. I hold only the Vistani in higher esteem. Give me a man who cloaks himself in mud and furs, and whose loyalty is unquestionable, rather than the unctuous merchant, twisting his rings of gold, brushing his finery, flattering with hollow words, all the while plotting to advance his own station.

**On what brought them to Barovia:**

Perhaps I did, to make you my playthings. Perhaps you are merely the last in a long line of sordid fortune seekers brought here to amuse me. Children have their dolls, men their womenfolk, their wine, their games of chance. I have you.

Or perhaps not. Perhaps you brought yourselves here, by the force of your yearnings. For there is something or someone each of you wants in Barovia. You must not underestimate the power of desire. It has built empires, slain invincible kings. It can shape the world you inhabit.

Or perhaps there is no reason at all. There is nothing wrong with a mystery. You will learn that in time. I will say no more on the subject.
