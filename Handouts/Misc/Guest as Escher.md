## On Playing as a Guest
Feel free to read all of this or just the tldr. You really can't mess any of this up. Play him however you see fit just with the summary of his current state in the tldr as a guide. The rest of this page goes into more detail about his history and what possible outcomes there might be with the party.

## Tldr;
Escher is a vampire spawn, formerly one of Strahd's lovers, but now disillusioned with his place in Castle Ravenloft. He is charming, witty, and possesses a cynical outlook. Despite his outward confidence, Escher deeply resents Strahd and seeks a way out of his servitude. Your role is to subtly manipulate the party, sow seeds of doubt, or possibly ally with them if it means escaping Strahd's control.

- Has already flirted with [[Anakir]]
	- and is super flirty in general; he loves any sort of attention and is not getting it from [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] recently
- In conversation, Escher displays wit with a hint of melancholy
- Beneath his arch mood is a dread that [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] is growing bored of him and will lock him in the catacombs  with Strahd's other castoff consorts

## The Posh Socialite
- one of the few sympathetic vampire spawn in the castle
	- He drinks blood willingly, so he's maintained his mind (vampires that don't drink blood regularly go mad), but he takes no joy in battle
	- He's a lover, not a fighter
- Escher is extremely well dressed, if a bit overly so
	- He loves fine clothes
- Escher is a very social individual
	- He loves talking to people and is very open and confident
	- He's actually been quite downtrodden over recent years, since [[Castle Ravenloft (K)|Castle Ravenloft]] has few people worth talking to

## Escher's Insecurities
- In an initial meeting, Escher should come across as overly confident
	- He speaks his mind, is open about his sexuality, and overall knows he's a hot dish
	- However, longer conversations and/or additional encounters should reveal his inner workings
- Escher is, first and foremost, lonely
	- He doesn't get along with any of the castle's current residents and Strahd has most certainly grown tired of him, which Escher suspects but doesn't know for certain
	- He knows what Strahd will do to him in the end (seal him away in the crypts) and it absolutely terrifies him
	- An eternity without human interaction or everyday comforts would be hell to Escher.
	
## Story Progression
Escher's deepest fears are being unwanted and unloved, both of which are coming true. And that terrifies him. This motivation can go one of two ways with your party:
1. The players become a source of friendship to Escher, offering him better connections than his vampiric ones and Escher therefore switches sides. Or,
2. Escher's desperation to remain unforgotten by Strahd will turn him into an enemy. Whichever happens will depend on your players' interactions with him.

**Should Escher switch sides**
- Remember that he's still a vampire spawn and must obey Strahd's orders
	- He's clever enough to work around the wording of different commands, but he'll make it clear to the party that his actions cannot always be his own, and he's very sorry about that
- Strahd just might put up with it for a little bit
	- It's probably the most interesting thing Escher's done in a while in Strahd's opinion
	- However, the end result will absolutely be Strahd crushing Escher
	- Such a blatant traitor will have to pay in the end
	- Unless, of course, the players deal will Strahd fast enough to save him.
- In-Game Flirting
    - Escher is one of the best characters in the game for flirting
    - If there's a particularly attractive male in your group of PCs, Escher will totally flirt with them.
	    - Remember, Escher is lonely and seeking companionship, even if it's meaningless sex
	    - Heaven knows Strahd's not much fun right now
	    - He's already flirted with [[Anakir]], but wouldn't be ashamed of flirting with others too
    - If the players continue to converse with Escher, his true personality should come through
