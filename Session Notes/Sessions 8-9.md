## Meeting Bella
The party scrambles to appear less intimidating, [[Bardolf]] showing his friendly grimace. [[Bella Sunbane]] introduces herself and apologizes for not being prepared to have company. She quickly starts moving stuff off of the furniture to make room for the party. She explains that her mother [[Morgantha]]/Granny is out selling pies, and that her sister [[Offalia Wormwiggle]] is upstairs working.

She tells the party that her great-grandmother found this place abandoned and moved in over a century ago. She's surprised and a bit angry to learn that the party possesses the deed and may be here to evict her. She tells the party that the pie recipe is one passed down multiple generations and is unfortunately a secret she cannot share. She asks [[Anakir]] for payment, and he buys even more pies to take with him.

[[Pelanil]], always cynical and always vigilant, takes off upstairs against [[Bella Sunbane|Bella]]'s protests. On the top floor of the windmill, he finds [[Offalia Wormwiggle|Offalia]] on the edge of a dirty bed pricking the finger of a little girl, [[Myrtle]]. Having been found out, both the old women transform into hags and the party start to fight

## Metarlos Bites Granny -- or The Fight at the Windmill
This fight proved to be maybe the hardest one the party has yet encountered. Here are some highlights:
- [[Bardolf]] spilled out the ichor that eventually started a fire in the windmill
	- The party then had to continue to fight as the fire spread upward
- [[Pelanil]] jumped from the 3rd story knocking both him and [[Morgantha|Granny]] prone
- [[Bardolf]] splashed [[Offalia Wormwiggle|Offalia]] with a jar of unknown liquid that made her suddenly beautiful
- [[Metarlos]] was temporarily turned into a mouse
- [[Shalooti]] called [[Bardolf]] "babe" (it's canon! Bella heard it!)
- [[Anakir]], [[Elora]], and [[Bardolf]] all got knocked unconscious at some point
- [[Morgantha|Granny]] came in pushing a cart with a wiggling sack on top; the party realized it was a boy, [[Lucien]]
- [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] struggled to unlock the locked crate containing [[Freek]]
- [[Metarlos]] bit [[Morgantha|Granny]] over and over and over
- [[Elora]] destroyed [[Bella Sunbane|Bella]] with psychic damage
- [[Morgantha|Granny]] tried to make an escape, but 3 swarms of ravens flying from the direction of [[The Town of Vallaki (N)|Vallaki]] killed her in her tracks
- [[Offalia Wormwiggle|Offalia]] blinked out of sight when she saw what happened to granny
- [[Pelanil]] busted through the wall of the burning windmill to save [[Bardolf]]

## After the Fight
The party retreats from the crumbling windmill to rest near the megaliths. As they tend to their wounds, [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] can be seen with her head in her hands, disappointed in her performance in battle. The kids, however, are drawn to her -- they already know her because she was a noble from the town the grew up in. She patches their clothes with some custom embroidered patches she's made. The party notices her gear is covered with these personal flourishes.
