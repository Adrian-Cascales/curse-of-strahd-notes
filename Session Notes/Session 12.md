## The Blue Water Inn
After the party finished up their conversation with [[Rictavio]], they heard a commotion downstairs. [[Elora]] poked her head out the door to see that some guards were giving [[Danika Dorakova|Danika]] a hard time. [[Pelanil]] goes downstairs to talk to her.

She tells the party that the guards found a dead body that the tiger apparently killed and that they're looking for [[Karl Wachter|Karl]] and [[Nikolai Wachter|Nikolai]] Wachter. She also tells [[Rictavio]] they'll eventually come for him when they realize he was involved. With that news he goes to pack his things and sneak out the back. He tells the party, "If you find yourself in trouble, you can find refuge in the small lake".

## St Andral's Church
At the church, the party meets [[Father Lucian Petrovich]] and [[Yeska]] the alter boy. [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] confides in [[Pelanil]], another man of god, that the bones that consecrate and thus protect the church have recently gone missing. He shows the party the cellar where they're normally stored, and [[Shalooti]] finds a dark, medium length hair.

After failing to persuade [[Yeska]] to spill the beans, [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] eventually shakes the boy until he finally tells her that he told [[Milivoj]], the (very attractive) gravedigger, about the bones. [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] points them to the orphanage next door.

## The Orphanage
Here, the party is shocked to find that, [[Lucien]], one of the children from the windmill that they dropped off, is dead, and that [[Milivoj]] is gravely ill. After some investigation, the party realizes that a newer boy at the orphanage, [[Felix]] is responsible.

When they find [[Felix]], they realize that he's been possessed, and so they fight the demon possessing him. [[Pelanil]] smites the demon with radiant light, making quick work of it. Before killing it, the demon possesses [[Shalooti]], threatens to cut [[Felix]] throat, and begs to be put back in its locket.

The party lures the demon toward the locket, slamming it shut last minute. Multiple party members strike final blows on the monster, and [[Anakir]] captures him in his pokeball ([[Orb of the Warmage]]).

[[Felix]], hog-tied, stirs awake, gasps, and begins to sob...
