## Spiders
In the thick webbing covering the room, [[Shalooti]] is able to make out figures moving about. There are nine pony-sized [[Giant Spider|Giant Spiders]] in the room. [[Pelanil]] opens another door to the same room to help in the fight. In an attempt to protect [[Shalooti]], [[Bardolf]] rushes in, but is glued to the wall with a web shot by one of the spiders. Once he's stuck, each of the nine spiders take turns biting him. [[Anakir]] takes out half of the spiders with another well-placed fireball, lighting the webbing on fire. [[Pelanil]] slams the door, and everyone escapes the room as the spiders burn alive.

## Exploring Argynvostholt
After encountering the spiders, the party is hesitant to check any more rooms on the ground floor.
- [[Pelanil]] proceeds up the stairs to inspect a tapestry depicting a nobleman
- [[Anakir]] finds a bathroom and a storage closet
	- He's just able to jump back to safety just as the floor gives in
- [[Bardolf]] pulls down a velvet curtain to reveal something covered on a marble pedestal
	- Pulling off the cover reveals [[Elora]]'s severed head
	- When shown to [[Elora]], she only sees a marble bust of a nobleman
- [[Shalooti]] opens another curtain to reveal an empty alcove
- [[Pelanil]] finds a guest room
- Later, [[Bardolf]] destroys a stained glass portrait of a religious figure as he continues growing his drapery collection

## Living Fire
Inside the guest room, [[Pelanil]] inspects a portrait above the mantle. It depicts the same person in the tapestry. As he studies the image, he suddenly remembers what he's heard about [[Argynvostholt (Q)|Argynvostholt]], how [[Argynvost]] was supposedly a silver dragon, and how, oftentimes, dragons will take on a human form when interacting with others. The person in the image must be [[Argynvost]]'s human form.

Just as [[Pelanil]] makes this realization, something stirs in the fireplace. Upon closer inspection, he sees a single ember struggling for life as it sluggishly pulls bits of ash towards itself. Intrigued, [[Pelanil]] moves the rotting mattress into the fireplace. With fuel to burn, the ember bursts into life, growing furiously until it assumes the shape of a small dragon with wings made of smoke. [[Pelanil]] plays with the small dragon a little bit, and he realizes it is blowing cool air onto his hands.

[[Anakir]] makes his way into the room to check out the commotion. He speaks to the to the blue-fire dragon in draconic, and upon hearing the words, it takes off, soaring past the players in a flurry of cold air and choking smoke.

## Argynvost
The other characters see the dragon burst from the room, and they all follow its smoke trail up the stairs. On the third floor of the building, the group finds that there is a huge hole in the ceiling of the building through which they can see the dark storm clouds outside. Sitting atop the rubble, a huge ethereal dragon dusts the debris beneath him with frost as he stares at the back of a throne through a destroyed wall.

As the group approaches, [[Argynvost]] asks for quiet and invites the party to join him in his study. There,   he relates to them the story of this castle: [[Argynvostholt's History]]. He also tells them:
- His knights are acting wonky
	- they just don't seem to be able to die
	- they can't see or hear him, but he can see them
	- they harbor deep hatred
		- he thinks that may be related to their predicament
- [[The Amber Temple (X)|The Amber Temple]] is south of here in the foothills of [[Mount Ghakis]]
	- He doesn't think they're strong enough to face the evils there yet
- [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] got his powers and immortality at [[The Amber Temple (X)|The Amber Temple]] from a [[Dark Powers|Dark Power]] named [[Vampyr]]
	- [[Vampyr]] is a dark god who lives in the mists
- His commander, [[Vladimir Horngaard]], found a relic many years ago that was able to repel evil
- He wants the beacon in the castle re-lit
	- he thinks that will fix his friends
- His hoard is not small, he swears

## Vlad
The party leave the study and continue to move around the castle. [[Pelanil]] passes by the room that [[Argynvost]] was staring into earlier, and notices something different this time. He sees a hand resting on the arm of the throne. The group goes around the other side to find that there is a corpse slumped over in the chair. He's holding what the party surmises to be a powerful magic greatsword, and wearing a sun-shaped platinum amulet.

[[Bardolf]] smacks the corpse in the head with his hammer, and reaches for the sword. The undead [[Vladimir Horngaard|Vladimir]] stirs and says "A corpse should be left well alone."
