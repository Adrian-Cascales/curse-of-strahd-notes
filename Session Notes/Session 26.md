## Bardolf's Wild Night
As the group settles in for the night, the last sliver of a waning crescent moon is blotted out by the fog. The party takes [[Bardolf]] to the cellar and ties him up with the chain. None of them decide to keep watch in the cellar, but each goes to find a bed in the house. [[Pelanil]] spends his night pacing.

At around midnight, [[Pelanil]] goes to check on [[Bardolf]]. He finds the secret door in the cellar is standing wide open and that [[Gadof Blinsky|Blinsky]]'s body parts are spread throughout the cellar. The chain is broken, and [[Bardolf]] is nowhere to be found. [[Pelanil]] ignores the problem, and goes to sit on the roof.

He watches the sunrise, then notices movement in the vineyard. His little bois are coming out of the woods and gathering around in a circle. [[Pelanil]] investigates.

He finds a nude [[Bardolf]] lying among the vines, covered in blood. He kicks [[Bardolf]] awake, and the little boys fetch him a leaf to protect his modesty.

Meanwhile, the rest of the group is enjoying breakfast with [[The Keepers of the Feather|The Martikovs]] when they realize that things are a lot quieter than normal, and subsequently, that [[Bardolf]] and [[Pelanil]] are missing. They finish up their breakfast and go to inspect the cellar, finding the scene exactly as [[Pelanil]] left it over night. [[Adrian Martikov|Adrian]] explains that they use the hidden cave as a sort of refrigerator for the wine. The group is surprised to find [[Gadof Blinsky|Blinsky]] here when they last saw him surrounded by vampires in [[The Town of Vallaki (N)|Vallaki]]. [[Adrian Martikov|Adrian]] drops hints that he'd like some help cleaning up, but when no one offers, reluctantly starts collecting [[Gadof Blinsky|Blinsky]]'s limbs.
## The Peasant Woman and the Magical Stones
The party sets out for [[Ruins of Berez (U)|Berez]]. Along they way, [[Shalooti]] spots a footrail off the main road, but decides not to follow it. After about three hour's travel from [[The Wizard of Wines (W)|The Wizard of Wines]], the group notices the river that they have been following is starting to become less distinct from its surrounding landscape and that the air is a bit stickier than before. The road becomes more and more muddy, and finally is covered by ankle-high water. [[Pelanil]] casts [[Water Walk]] on the group, and they are able to proceed without being slowed down.

The see the ruined town of [[Ruins of Berez (U)|Berez]] covered in swamp. They also notice a light among some standing stones across the river. [[Elora]] stealthily made her way across the raging river, and was able to see a peasant woman standing there holding a lantern and a dagger. She reports what she saw back to the party.

The rest of the group decides that this must be [[Baba Lysaga]], so they each in turn sneak perfectly unnoticed across the river. The others hide as [[Bardolf]] approaches the woman to learn more. She is surprised to learn that the group is going to risk talking to [[Baba Lysaga]]. Confident that the woman isn't, herself, [[Baba Lysaga]], the rest of the party present themselves (except for [[Anakir]], whose new thing is that he's always invisible).

They learn the woman's name is [[Muriel Vinshaw]], and she is there spying on [[Baba Lysaga]] for [[The Keepers of the Feather|The Martikovs]]. She stays on this side of the river because she is too fearful to get too close to the witch. She warns the party of the various dangers in the swamps, and tells them to watch out for the scarecrows.

Before making their way back across the river, the party takes a closer look at the stones. They recognize that they are very similar to the ones they saw at [[Old Bonegrinder (O)|The Windmill]]. [[Bardolf]] recognizes that these stone structures are incredibly old, probably built well before [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] moved into the valley centuries ago. He also realized the stones probably have magical powers, but wasn't sure how he could activate them.

The group crosses the river, and heads the direction that [[Muriel Vinshaw|Muriel]] points them towards [[Baba Lysaga]]'s hut. Along the way, the have to fight off a couple [[Giant Poisonous Snake]].
## Baba Lysaga
Finally, they come across what must be [[Baba Lysaga]]'s hut built atop an old tree stump. Attached to the hut are cages full ravens, squawking and fluttering, across the way is a castle, in front of which is a pen full of goats, and right in front of the door to the hut is what the party presumes must be [[Argynvost]]'s skull upside-down and sunken into the mud.

[[Pelanil]], rushes into the hut, giving [[Baba Lysaga]] no time to react to their approach. Inside, he sees and old woman leaning over a crib with a baby inside, and below the crib, he sees a green light emanating from beneath the floorboards. [[Pelanil]] immediately casts [[Silence]] so that the presumed witch will have no chance of using the required verbal components for her spells. He then slices into her with her with his greatsword. [[Anakir]] then uses [[Banishment]] to send her to another plane. The party has one minute to act before she returns!

[[Shalooti]] frantically looks through the herbs stored in the cupboard. She finds something that looks like a root, and notices it's labeled with "Belladonna Root". [[Anakir]] checks on the baby to find out that it's an illusion when his hands move right through it. [[Pelanil]] begins pulling on the floorboards beneath the crib.

Just as [[Pelanil]] begins to move the floorboards, the house shutters and jerks. Its roots lurch and groan as the pull from the ground. [[Anakir]] is unable to hold his feet, and is flung from the hut, falling 10 feet. [[Shalooti]] and [[Pelanil]] hold strong and continue to work at the floorboards. Seeing this from outside, [[Bardolf]] grabs onto the stump with a pickaxe, but is batted away by the root-legs of the monster-hut.

Unperturbed, [[Bardolf]] lassos the the chimney. Again he's batted away and is, this time, knocked unconscious. The house throws rocks at [[Anakir]] who is also knocked unconscious.

After much effort, [[Pelanil]] and [[Shalooti]] are able to break the floorboards and retrieve the glowing green gem inside. [[Shalooti]] uses her [[Mage Hand]] to pick up the gem and deliver it to [[Elora]] outside. With that, the hut shutters one last time, and collapses to the ground.

Before [[Baba Lysaga]] popped back into this plane, the group healed [[Bardolf]] and [[Anakir]], and each person readied an attack at the spot where [[Baba Lysaga]] last stood. She re-appeared, and the party took turns whacking her with their favorite method. She did not stand a chance.
