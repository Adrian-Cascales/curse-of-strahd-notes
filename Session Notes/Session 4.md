## The Shrine
[[Anakir]] refused to head the warnings of the shadows in the shrine, and kept the orb for himself. The party went to battle with the shadows, and [[Shalooti]] briefly put them to sleep and the party retreated and discussed how to hide.

While arguing over what to do next, the party hears the shadows awake to begin again their chant of "Return the Orb. Begone from this place". [[Pelanil]] ran back to the shouting shadows and blasted them with radiant light, obliterating each of them.

[[Bardolf]] followed the secret stairs up to find a trap door leading to the room with the stuffed wolves -- a quick escape if needed later.

## Interring the Children
Having taken care of the immediate danger, and healing the party, [[Pelanil]] takes [[Rosevalda|Rose]] and [[Thornboldt|Thorn]]'s bones back to their tombs and laid them to rest.

## Exploring Lower
Using the key she found around [[Gustav Durst|Gustav]]'s neck, [[Elora]] opened the gate that lead downward towards the chanting. Quietly sneaking down the stairs, the party finds themselves in a reliquary full of trophies, all severed body parts.

Now they can hear the chanting clearly, "He is the Ancient. He is the Land".

The party quickly delves into a sort of jail cell, where [[Elora]] finds a ring on the finger of a skeleton, and [[Anakir]] found a secret door which he cowered away from, and [[Shalooti]] pulled out some cheese to try to make friends with a rat. Then, the party made their way back to reliquary to track down the source of the chanting once and for all.

The party found the chanting coming from a room blocked by a portcullis and flooded with water. [[Shalooti]] used her mage hand to turn the wooden wheel on the other side of portcullis to let the party through.

## The Altar
Once inside, the party is presented with a large flooded room with a raised dais in the center covered with blood

[[Elora]] walks to the top, and 13 spirits appear along the ledge surrounding the room and begin chanting "One must Die!". Thinking quickly, [[Shalooti]] pulls out some more cheese (the most pungent ever seen by the party), and attracts dozens of rats who swim all around the dais.

The party frantically grasps at the rats, [[Elora]] the only one able to successfully trap one. Ignoring pleas from the other members, she pulled out a dagger, sliced off its head, and allowed its blood to cover the altar.

The chanting stops for just a moment.

## Walter
Then, "Lorghoth the Decayer, we awaken thee!‚Äù

As the spirits' chant changes, [[Pelanil]] notices that the pile of rubbish in the adjacent room begins moving. Out of the room bursts an amalgamation of various body parts.

The party fights with this monster, making only slow progress. Notably, [[Bardolf]] drenched it in grease while [[Pelanil]] struck it with magic fire. Then, out of nowhere, the beast morphed around [[Pelanil]] consuming him and wrapping him in viscera.

While trying to fight his way out of the monster, [[Pelanil]] found its heart: the re-animated corpse of baby [[Walter]]. Working quickly, [[Pelanil]] was able to separate the corpse from the muscles that attached it to the monster. Immediately, the monster fell to pieces, the chanting shadows left, and all was finally quiet.

## The Children's Thanks
Followed by the rest of the party, [[Pelanil]] laid to rest baby [[Walter]] and [[Margaret]]. Just has he closed the lid to the coffin, the party was struck by a vision. They saw [[Rosevalda|Rose]] and [[Thornboldt|Thorn]] alive and playing with [[Margaret]]. They saw [[Gustav Durst|Mr. Durst]]'s impropriety [[Elizabeth Durst|Elizabeth]]'s jealousy. They saw [[Elizabeth Durst|Elizabeth]] turn to dark magic in search for a youthful body. They saw [[Elizabeth Durst|Elizabeth]] take [[Walter]] from [[Margaret]] and sacrifice him on the altar. Then they saw, the [[Dark Powers]] enter the house and fully corrupt [[Elizabeth Durst|Elizabeth]].

In the end, they see the ghosts of the children and [[Margaret]] once more as [[Rosevalda|Rose]] thanks the party for saving [[Walter]] just before fading from sight.

## Finally Out of the House
After freeing the spirits from death house, the party walks out at level 3.

[[Bardolf]] unties a hungry [[Carlos]], and as the party goes wandering in search of a place to rest, they encounter a friendly old lady, [[Morgantha]], who insists they call her Granny. Granny sells the party some of her delicious homemade pies, and the party scarfs them down right away. Granny also offers the following information:
- Rumor is that [[Kolyan Indirovich|Burgomaster Indirovich]] is dead and that his son, [[Ismark Kolyanovich]] is set to replace him (Granny doesn't believe in his leadership)
- The party can find a place to rest at [[Village of Barovia (E)#Blood of the Vine Tavern (E2)|The Blood of the Vine Tavern]]
- [[Bildrath Cantemir]] sells wares on the other side of town
- [[Mad Mary|Mary Swilova]]'s daughter [[Gertruda]] has recently gone missing and Mary is beside herself
- The players are in the Land of Barovia, ruled by [[Strahd Von Zarovich]]

Exhausted, [[Pelanil]] heads directly to the tavern, where he pays for a bath, and proceeds to the bar.

[[Bardolf]] heads to [[Village of Barovia (E)#Bildrath's Mercantile (E1)|Bildrath's Mercantile]] to find some feed for [[Carlos]]. [[Bildrath Cantemir|Bildrath]] is unwilling to budge on his incredibly high prices, so [[Bardolf]] is forced to pay top dollar. As [[Barovia]] tries to bargain, [[Bildrath Cantemir|Bildrath]] summons his nephew [[Parriwimple]] to deal with [[Bardolf]].

Eventually, the party meets up at the [[Village of Barovia (E)#Blood of the Vine Tavern (E2)|Blood of the Vine Tavern]] where they are finally ready to get some well-deserved rest.
