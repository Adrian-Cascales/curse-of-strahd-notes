## At the Bar
The session starts with [[Rictavio]] telling a story, and the tavern eating it up. At the bar, the party each engages in their own separate conversations.

### Brom and Bray
[[Shalooti]] disguises herself as a little boy, and makes friends with [[Brom Martikova|Brom]] and [[Bray Martikov|Bray]] who are the sons of [[Danika Dorakova|Danika]] and [[Urwin Martikov|Urwin]], the owners of the Inn. They let her in on their game of eavesdropping, and share some of the secrets they've heard.

### Urwin Martikov
[[Anakir]] gets into [[Urwin Martikov|Urwin]]'s private family matters when he learns the [[Urwin Martikov|Urwin]]'s father at the [[The Wizard of Wines (W)|Wizard of the Wines]] has not sent any wine shipments recently. [[Urwin Martikov|Urwin]] asks if [[Anakir]] would consider looking into the problem.

### The Wolf Hunters
[[Bardolf]] offers two wolf hunters 3gp each now and his 50gp bejeweled eyepatch when they return, if they will go back to [[Village of Barovia (E)|Barovia Village]] to retrieve [[Carlos]].

### The Wachter Brothers
[[Shalooti]], [[Bardolf]], and [[Anakir]] talk to [[Nikolai Wachter|Nikolai]] and [[Karl Wachter|Karl]] who they learn are [[Fiona Wachter|Lady Fiona Wachter]]'s sons. They offer to "Do a dare" for money. [[Bardolf]] convinces them to go steal something from [[Rictavio]]'s wagon in exchange for his bejeweled eyepatch (the one he already promised to the wolf hunters).

### Rictavio
After his story, [[Pelanil]] and [[Elora]] corner [[Rictavio]] to find out what he knows about his place in [[Madam Eva]]'s [[Card Reading]]. He initially claims to not be the person the fortune references, but the next day finally admits it's probably him. He helps decipher the [[Card Reading]].

## A Good Night's Rest...?
The party goes to bed, but [[Bardolf]] waits up for the Wachter brothers to return from [[Rictavio]]'s wagon. The party wakes to the sound of a tiger, and the brothers burst through the door distraught. [[Bardolf]] goes to retrieve his lost eyepatch, and [[Shalooti]] tails him.

At the Stockyard, [[Bardolf]] finds his eyepatch at [[Rictavio]]'s wagon. He takes some treasure from the wagon, and he also takes some damage trying to pick the lock to the front seat of the wagon.

When confronted by [[Gunther Arasek]], [[Bardolf]] and [[Shalooti]] convince him that [[Bardolf]] was just having a BM, and not doing any thieving.

## Breakfast
The party talks to [[Danika Dorakova|Danika]] who says the tiger wasn't yet found. They're enjoying breakfast when an angry [[Rictavio]] finally makes it back to the Inn after taking inventory of the damage to his wagon. He invites the party back to his room.

## The Tome of Strahd
There, he reveals he wasn't 100% honest with [[Pelanil]]. He's actually a spy undercover as a carnival master (a damn good one if he says so himself). He's monitoring the [[Vistani]] and the goings-on in [[The Town of Vallaki (N)|Vallaki]]. He fulfils the first of [[Madam Eva]]'s predictions, and gives the party a journal written by [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]].
