## Out of Vallaki
On their third day in town, the party finally head out of [[The Town of Vallaki (N)|Vallaki]]. They walk through the western gate with [[Izek Strazni|Izek]] in tow.

Just out of town, they hear a commotion to the south: music and cheers! [[Shalooti]] remembers that [[Arabelle]] said she lived in a camp to the south of [[The Town of Vallaki (N)|Vallaki]], and imagines that the [[Vistani]] there are probably celebrating the return of the lost [[Arabelle]]. Afraid that [[Anakir]] may have angered them by asking for money, the party decides to keep heading west towards [[Argynvostholt (Q)|Argynvostholt]].

After some time of travelling, the party comes to the [[Luna River Crossroads (P)|Luna River Crossroads]]. They see a broken sign that points in four directions. [[Bardolf]] is able mend the post, and after some discussion, the group decides their best course will be to follow the road southwest towards "[[Village of Krezk (S)|Krezk]] and [[Tsolenka Pass (T)|Tsolenka Pass]]".

## Berserkers and Bats
Shortly after departing the crossroads, [[Pelanil]] turns a bend to find 3 [[Berserker]]s waiting. The group fights the monsters in some very close hand-to-hand combat. We also learn just how powerful [[Izek Strazni|Izek's]] (aka Hulk Hogan, brother) demon arm really is.

After finally slaying the last [[Berserker]] as it fled, the party isn't quite yet able to take a breath. [[Anakir]] notices 4 bats flying overhead. Just as he sees them, they begin flying away. Thinking quickly, he casts [[Fireball]]. All 4 bats fall from the sky. Just as the land, they turn into Vampire Spawn, (just like the ones the party encountered during the [[The Town of Vallaki (N)#The Feast of St Andral|Feast of St Andral]] in [[The Town of Vallaki (N)|Vallaki]]), and begin twitching on the ground from their injuries.

The group decides to quickly dispatch 3 of the four, leaving one alive to question. [[Izek Strazni|Izek]] picks him up with his demon arm and intimidates him enough to tell the party what he knows:
- His name is [[Vadu]]
	- He was once an uneducated peasant with abusive parents
	- He revels in his vampiric power, and does anything [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] tells him
- He and his fellow spawn have been spying on the party since they arrived in Barovia
- [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] took [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] to [[The Abbott]]  at the [[Abbey of Saint Markovia]] in [[Village of Krezk (S)|Krezk]] and didn't return to [[Castle Ravenloft (K)|Castle Ravenloft]] with her

After telling the party what he knows, his body goes limp in [[Izek Strazni|Izek]]'s arms.

The group briefly considers making their way to [[Village of Krezk (S)|Krezk]] to see if there is a chance they can save [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]]. Just as [[Shalooti]] remembers [[Urwin Martikov|Urwin]]'s and [[Danika Dorakova|Danika]]'s advice ([[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] is likely lost, and they should focus on gathering power and allies), she hears a raven squawk. Following the sound, the raven leads them towards [[Argynvostholt (Q)|Argynvostholt]].

## Argynvostholt
With the evening setting in, the group arrives at the sepulchral mansion, the southern wall of which is completely destroyed.

Out front, they see a statue of what they gather to be a noble silver dragon, looking towards the mansion. [[Shalooti]] notices that there is a dilapidated stables on the southern side of the mansion.

[[Anakir]], dragonborn as he is, tries to talk with the statue, but with no luck. [[Bardolf]] enchants it to say the words "Begone brother" when someone walks by.

Impatience ever growing since his rebirth, [[Pelanil]] makes his way to the front door of the mansion. As he climbs the steps, the statue opens its mouth and exhales a gust of harmless cold air as it says the words "Begone brother". The group recognizes at this point, that the statue was once set up to protect this mansion from intruders, but has since lost the power behind its magic.

Making their way inside, the group sees a winged shadow flutter through the foyer. [[Shalooti]] opens the door on the left to find a room covered wall to wall in thick spider webs...
