The search for the bones continues...

## The Orphanage
After destroying the demon, the party tries to console [[Felix]]. He admits that he remembers killing both his parents and [[Lucien]].

[[Shalooti]] goes to see if [[Milivoj]] is still ~~attractive~~ alive. The party find him awake and full of teenage angst. He admits to them that he stole the bones and sold them to [[Henrik van der Voort]], the Coffin Shop owner, for money to support the orphanage.

The party takes a short rest on the way out of the orphanage, and a grateful [[Ms Belasco|Dr Velasco]] offers them the leftover [[reference/items/Potion of Healing|Potions of Healing]] that [[Milivoj]] no longer needs. [[Myrtle]] shows the party that [[Felix]] destroyed her favorite doll and asks them have it fixed at [[The Town of Vallaki (N)#Blinsky Toys]].

The party head to the toy shop, but [[Bardolf]] stays behind to play rocks with [[Freek]].


## Blinsky Toys
The party meet, [[Gadof Blinsky]], a lonely toymaker with a really weird accent. They bargain down the price of fixing the doll, but after coming to pity him, offer him more than he originally asked for.

Scanning the wares, [[Pelanil]] notices something alarming: there is a doll that looks just like [[Elora]] on the shelf. [[Gadof Blinsky|Blinsky]], after being charmed by [[Anakir]], spills the beans that [[Izek Strazni]] has been coming in for years asking him to make the same doll with more and more precision, threatening to burn down his store otherwise.

[[Elora]] buys this specific doll from [[Gadof Blinsky|Blinsky]] who says he can make another before [[Izek Strazni|Izek]] comes for it, and also picks up a [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] dummy.

[[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] heads back to the orphanage to drop off the doll to [[Myrtle]].

## Ernst and Anakir
Outside the toy store, the party is approached by [[Ernst Larnak|Ernst "Little Finger" Larnak]]. He tells the group that his master, [[Fiona Wachter|Lady Wachter]], has taken notice to their presence in town and has asked for an audience at dinner to discuss [[Vargas Vallakovich|The Burgomaster]].

[[Anakir]], having failed to seduce literally every other person in town today, finally has some luck with [[Ernst Larnak|Little Finger]]. [[Ernst Larnak|Ernst]] leads [[Anakir]] back to [[The Town of Vallaki (N)#Wachterhaus]] and up to [[Karl Wachter|Karl]] and [[Nikolai Wachter|Nikolai]]'s room. Before they can slip inside and fade to black, the door across the hall opens, and [[Fiona Wachter|Lady Fiona Wachter]] walks out with young man in tow.

## Lady Wachter
After introductions, [[Fiona Wachter|Fiona]] informs [[Anakir]] and [[Ernst Larnak|Ernst]] that this messenger told her that her sons are currently being hanged. [[Anakir]] offers help, but [[Fiona Wachter|Fiona]] declines, saying she believes her conversation with [[Anakir]] is far more important.

![[Assets/Images/People/Fiona_Wachter_29.webp|150]]

She gives [[Anakir]] time to collect himself and says to meet her downstairs to talk. Once downstairs, she tells him the following:
- She's not happy with the rule of [[Vargas Vallakovich|The Baron]]:
	- [[Vargas Vallakovich|Vargas]] isn't the first terrible Burgomaster of the Vallakovich family. Each Burgomaster has been just as terrible, if not worse, in their rules.
	- [[Vargas Vallakovich|Vargas]] and his captain, [[Izek Strazni]], are brutes. Many believe only [[Izek Strazni|Izek]] is responsible for torturing prisoners, but she knows that [[Vargas Vallakovich|Vargas]] has his own mean streak. Perhaps that is why his wife, [[Lydia Petrovna|Lydia]], is so delicate in nature...
	- [[Fiona Wachter|Fiona]] tried to do the diplomatic thing and consolidate an understanding with [[Vargas Vallakovich|The Burgomaster]] by arranging the marriage between their children. However, she was unaware that [[Victor Vallakovich]] could be as cruel as his father at so young an age. Though she doesn't know what exactly [[Victor Vallakovich|Victor]] did to make her daughter lose her mind, she knows it must have been horrible.
- When [[Anakir]] asked about her thoughts on [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]]:
	- [[Fiona Wachter|Fiona]] brazenly calls [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] by name, directly against Vallaki's laws
		- She says she does this because she has no fear of him.
	- She sees no monster in the land but [[Vargas Vallakovich|Vargas]] himself. Fiona believes that Vargas' fear of Strahd is only an excuse to get away with mistreating the people of Vallaki. She believes Vargas actively sows that fear to get the people to follow to him in a great conspiracy.
	- **Disillusioned to the Vallakoviches' Rule**
		- Grew up under [[Boris Vallakovich]]'s ([[Vargas Vallakovich|Vargas]]'s father) harsh rule, then saw [[Vargas Vallakovich]] come to power to be just as bad
			- They did their evil deeds and abused their power in the name of protection against [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]], but he was a distant non-threat in her eyes
	- **Made a pact with Strahd**
		- At 15, her parents let her make a trip to [[Village of Barovia (E)|Barovia Village]] for political connections, but she took a detour to [[Castle Ravenloft (K)|Ravenloft]] to see what the big deal was
			- [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]], ever the gentleman, entertained her visit
			- He saw her potential, and offered a place among his consorts
			- She declined, saying she could be a better resource with information from [[The Town of Vallaki (N)|Vallaki]]
			- [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] agreed to the alliance
	- **The Prophesy**
		- on her way back to [[The Town of Vallaki (N)|Vallaki]], she stopped to meet [[Madam Eva]] and got the following fortune:
			- First, there would be the coming of an outsider to Vallaki, foreign to this land. The coming of this outsider would mark the beginning of a new age in Vallaki.
			- The coming of the outsider would also bring a great ruin. A purge on the town like none other.
			- But when the ruin was done, the blood of the outsider would shed sunlight on Vallaki yet again.

## Pelanil
[[Pelanil]] takes off from the toy shop to fetch [[Bardolf]]. On they way, he gets distracted by a commotion at the town square. He sees Wachter brothers on the gallows as [[Izek Strazni|Izek]] puts a rope around their necks and [[Vargas Vallakovich|The Burgomaster]] looks on.

![[Assets/Images/People/izek.webp|150]]
![[Assets/Images/People/Baron_Vargas_Vallakovich.jpg|150]]

Just as [[Izek Strazni|Izek]] begins to pull the lever, [[Pelanil]] casts [[Thaumaturgy]] to distract the executioners and the crowd. Everyone hears whispers saying "Don't do it" just as the ground begins to shake and windows doors begin to open and close. Chaos ensues as shouts of "The Devil has returned" echo through the streets. [[Vargas Vallakovich|The Burgomaster]] and [[Izek Strazni|Izek]] try to calm the crowd, shouting "The Devil has not returned. He's not been in this town for over a century!" 

At that moment, another well placed [[Thaumaturgy]] casting echoes another voice claiming to be [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] himself. Now terrified himself, [[Vargas Vallakovich|Vargas]] gets an escort back to his mansion.

[[Pelanil]] runs towards the gallows where he now sees a mounted [[Bardolf]]. He gets [[Izek Strazni|Izek]]'s attention and burns through the ropes, releasing the brothers. [[Izek Strazni|Izek]] is outraged at the miscarriage of justice, and he rushes towards [[Pelanil]] with his battle-axe drawn.

\[... Meanwhile]

## Shalooti, Elora, and the Search for the Bones
At the coffin shop, [[Shalooti]] and [[Elora]] are greeted with a locked door and shuttered windows. Inside, [[Henrik van der Voort|Henrik]] tells them to go away. When he doesn't seem to be relenting, [[Elora]] picks the lock and lets herself in.

![[Henrik van der Voort.jpg|150]]

[[Henrik van der Voort|Henrik]] is not pleased to have company, but doesn't put up much of a fight. He is, however, very tight lipped when asked about the bones. Only when threatened with violence does he simply say "they're upstairs". He doesn't say anything when asked if there is anyone else in the house.

On the way up, they see that there is a bedroll in the junk room that someone has apparently been sleeping in for months.

As they open the door to the stairwell, [[Shalooti]] and [[Elora]]'s spines chill, and they can't help but feel they're being watched.

Upstairs, they find an unused bedroom and kitchen. They surmise that [[Henrik van der Voort|Henrik]] has not been living up here for some time. Inside the wardrobe, they find some cash, and some old dusty bones. [[Elora]] opens up a line of psychic communication with [[Bardolf]] and [[Pelanil]].

Just as [[Elora]] takes the bones, they hear something stirring in the next room over. At this, they run for the door, and just outside the kitchen, they're met by a vampire spawn who quickly snatches the bones and takes off down the stairs.

## Bardolf
[[Bardolf]] has always enjoyed playing with rocks. This, of course, was his game of choice growing up under the mountain. And even though he never says a word, [[Freek]] is a wonderful counterpart. [[Bardolf]] gets lost in thought, playing amongst the laughing children. He's finally found a bit of peace in this dark world.

As his mind wanders, he thinks about his family, and about his ancestors. Suddenly, he remembers his father who was killed by hanging many years ago. He remembers this with a start as he realizes his friends have been gone far too long. He thanks [[Freek]] for playing and leaves with him the teeth he found at [[Old Bonegrinder (O)|Old Bonegrinder]]. [[Freek]] puts them all in his mouth and gives [[Bardolf]] an extra large goodbye smile.

[[Bardolf]] makes his way to the toy shop, but is distracted by screaming and tremors coming from the town square. As he heads that direction, he is trampled by the herd of people running. Once he regains his feet, he finds an approaching [[Metarlos]] and mounts him to get up above the crowd. From his mount, he spots the Wachter brothers at the gallows as well as [[Izek Strazni|Izek]] and a fleeing [[Vargas Vallakovich|Vargas]]. And in the shadows, he sees [[Pelanil]] and make eye contact with one another.

Feeling responsible for their current predicament, [[Bardolf]] takes off towards the brothers in hopes of freeing them from their ropes. He sees [[Pelanil]] strike the ropes with magic fire, freeing the boys, but invoking the wrath of [[Izek Strazni|Izek]].

Just as he sees [[Pelanil]] engage with [[Izek Strazni|Izek]], he thinks he sees the sun finally poking through the mists...
