## The Coffin Shop
At the coffin shop, [[Elora]] and [[Shalooti]] realize the pure scale of the chaos they've unleashed. The pair are able to recover the bones from the vampire spawn, just as fourteen more spill out of the same room and proceed to wreak havoc on the town. As [[Elora]] and [[Shalooti]] run for church, they notice [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] riding into town on his flaming horse, [[Beucephalus]].

## Wachterhaus
[[Fiona Wachter|Lady Wachter]] asks [[Anakir]] for his help taking down [[Vargas Vallakovich|The Burgomaster]]. They're both surprised when a man bursts through the door with the news that her sons are alive thanks to her "Messiahs". [[Anakir]] follows [[Fiona Wachter|Lady Wachter]] through a secret door to her cellar where he's met by some of her followers who reiterate the importance of his assistance. Afraid for his safety, he turns invisible and makes his way towards the rest of the party.

## The Town Square
[[Bardolf]] and [[Pelanil]] are able to convince [[Izek Strazni|Izek]] to join their fight against [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]]. [[Bardolf]] and [[Izek Strazni|Izek]] make their way towards the others, while [[Pelanil]] sprints towards [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] (at the orphanage) and the church.

## All Together
Eventually, [[Izek Strazni]] and [[Bardolf]] meet up with [[Shalooti]] and [[Elora]]. [[Izek Strazni|Izek]] wraps [[Elora]] in a big hug and tells her he's shocked to see her alive. No time to explain presently, he promises her a chat once things calm down.

Unbeknownst to the rest of the party, a still-invisible [[Anakir]] begins following them.

Nearly to the church, they see [[Pelanil]] fighting with one of the vampire spawn. Just as he's bitten, and part of his life is drained from him, [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] comes out of nowhere to miraculously down the vampire from behind.

## The Church
The party realizes it's gotten darker outside; there is no sight of [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] and the flaming [[Beucephalus]]. Hesitant, they make their way into the church. For extra precaution, [[Pelanil]] leaves magical fire at the door.

Inside the church, they're greeted by none other than [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]]. Apparently happy to see each other again, he's able to charm his dear friend [[Elora]] into bringing him the bones she's been carrying. [[Bardolf]] is able to act quickly enough to take the bones from her, only to have one of the spawn (damaged by the fire at the door) steal them from him and deliver them to his master.
