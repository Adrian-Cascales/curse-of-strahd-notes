## Tser Pool
The party picks up in [[Madam Eva]]'s tent, where they ask her a bunch of questions about [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] and about the land. She gives them some information, but the party is left distrustful in her some of her non-answers. They learn from [[Madam Eva]]:
-  A vampire must rest in its coffin during the day
	- At night, it can summon wolves and vermin to do its bidding
	- A vampire can transform into a bat, a wolf, or a cloud of mist
	- In its humanoid form, it can dominate you with its powerful gaze
- Many strangers have been drawn to Barovia over the years, but they all die or disappear before long

After speaking with [[Madam Eva]], the party leaves her tent to sit around the fire with [[Arahja]], [[Rina]], and about a dozen other [[Vistani]]. [[Arahja]] asks the characters about their intentions in Barovia as well as for more information about their lives outside of Barovia. [[Bardolf]] shares this information freely, much to [[Pelanil]]'s disapproval.

[[Shalooti]] plays Lizzo for the group, who applaud vigorously. And one of the [[Vistani]] recounts a story to the group about a mighty wizard who rallied a mob to take on [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]]. The wizard was overthrown by [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] and fell a thousand feet to his death, and his body was washed away by the river.

## Back on the Road
The party set out early in the morning to make their way toward [[The Town of Vallaki (N)|Vallaki]]. [[Bardolf]] doesn't stir, so with the help of [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]], [[Pelanil]] ties him to [[Metarlos|Molly]] ([[Metarlos]] gained a new name). [[Shalooti]] fetches a med kit from [[Madam Eva]], and the party sets off.

Along the road, the party is met with some wild looking people
