## Tser Pool
The party picks up in [[Madam Eva]]'s tent, where they ask her a bunch of questions about [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] and about the land. She gives them some information, but the party is left distrustful in her some of her non-answers. They learn from [[Madam Eva]]:
-  A vampire must rest in its coffin during the day
	- At night, it can summon wolves and vermin to do its bidding
	- A vampire can transform into a bat, a wolf, or a cloud of mist
	- In its humanoid form, it can dominate you with its powerful gaze
- Many strangers have been drawn to Barovia over the years, but they all die or disappear before long

After speaking with [[Madam Eva]], the party leaves her tent to sit around the fire with [[Arahja]], [[Rina]], and about a dozen other [[Vistani]]. [[Arahja]] asks the characters about their intentions in Barovia as well as for more information about their lives outside of Barovia. [[Bardolf]] shares this information freely, much to [[Pelanil]]'s disapproval.

[[Shalooti]] plays Lizzo for the group, who applaud vigorously. And one of the [[Vistani]] recounts a story to the group about a mighty wizard who rallied a mob to take on [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]]. The wizard was overthrown by [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] and fell a thousand feet to his death, and his body was washed away by the river.

## Back on the Road
The party set out early in the morning to make their way toward [[The Town of Vallaki (N)|Vallaki]]. [[Bardolf]] doesn't stir, so with the help of [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]], [[Pelanil]] ties him to [[Metarlos|Molly]] ([[Metarlos]] gained a new name). [[Shalooti]] fetches a med kit from [[Madam Eva]], and the party sets off.

Along the road, the party is met with some wild looking people while [[Bardolf]] continues to sleep tied to [[Metarlos|Molly]]. Eventually, he's bucked awake by [[Metarlos|Molly]], and [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] unties him. With the party at full strength, they're able to overpower the foes. Having taken damage, [[Pelanil]] spends the next hour healing and riding [[Metarlos|Molly]].

The party pass through the [[River Ivlis Crossroads (F)|River Ivlis Crossroads]] again, make their way across the bridge spanning the river at [[Tser Falls (H)|Tser Falls]], travel through the western [[Gates of Barovia (B)|Gates of Barovia]],

## The Windmill
At around noon, after travelling along the ridgeline, [[Shalooti]] is the first to see the mountains open up to a valley below and a walled town near the shores of a great lake. And just off to her left, a branch in the road that leads to a [[Old Bonegrinder (O)|Windmill]]. After some discussion and input from a tired [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]], the party decides to investigate.

[[Shalooti]] hears whistling coming from inside, and [[Elora]] climbs a rope provided by [[Bardolf]] to peek in the second floor window. She sees inside a large millstone, and an old woman in an apron covered in flour and blood. She's whistling to herself as she sweeps up debris, stirring up a cloud of white dust.

As she climbs back down, [[
