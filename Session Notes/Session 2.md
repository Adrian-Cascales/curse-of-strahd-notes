	- We learn that their names are Rose and Thorn
- As we enter the house, the party sees that the place is immaculate but shrouded in darkness
	- Floors well oiled and the furniture freshly dusted
	- Doors seem to be opening and closing on their own
	- The stuffed wolves seem to be watching us
	- The ornate carvings in the wood paneling is not always as it seems
- Shortly after entering, the party splits up.
