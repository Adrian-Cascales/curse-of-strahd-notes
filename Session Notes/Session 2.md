[[Anakir]], [[Elora]], [[Shalooti]], [[Pelanil]], [[Bardolf]]

- The party shortly question the kids outside of the House
	- We learn that their names are [[Rose]] and [[Thorn]]
- As we enter the house, the party sees that the place is immaculate but shrouded in darkness
	- Floors well oiled and the furniture freshly dusted
	- Doors seem to be opening and closing on their own
	- The stuffed wolves seem to be watching us
	- The ornate carvings in the wood paneling is not always as it seems
- Shortly after entering, the party splits up
	- [[Anakir]] and [[Pelanil]] run upstairs, chasing the sound of a harpsicord
	- The rest of the group stays on the first floor as [[Bardolf]] searches for loot
		- [[Bardolf]], taken by the quality of the dining room drapes, tears them to shreds as he tries to cut them down. He pockets the silverware instead
	- [[Shalooti]] explores a room full of stuffed wolves, and finds herself a deck of playing cards, but runs out of the room before she can unlock the other cabinet with the crossbows
- As [[Pelanil]] and [[Anakir]] reach the second floor, the sound of the harpsicord is soon replaced by that of a wailing child
	- [[Anakir]] attacks a completely ordinary suit of armor, unable to take its spear
	- They stop halfway to the third floor as they hear footsteps and a woman shushing the baby
	- [[Anakir]] sends a message to [[Elora]] telling her that they know where the baby is, but her response is cut off by maniacal laughing
		- Instead of his second message, [[Elora]] hears heavy breathing
		- and upon trying to contact the woman upstairs, [[Anakir]] senses his message has been redirected miles away where a man answers and says he looks forward to meeting him
- The party regroups on the second floor where they find their way to the library
	- Inside, [[Elora]] finds an iron key among other things at the desk
	- While pursuing the books, [[Shalooti]], finds a secret lever that opens a door to a secret room
- Inside the secret room, the party sees other books that reference the occult
	- they also see a human skeleton, near a chest, with a poison dart in their side, holding a note
	- in the chest, they find the dead to the house, a deed to the windmill, and a will signed by [[Elizabeth Durst]] and [[Gustav Durst]] bequeathing the house and windmill to their two children [[Thornboldt]] and [[Rosevalda]]
	- The letter held by the skeleton is so terrifying it sends [[Shalooti]] into a panic and she flees the room
		- As [[Anakir]] tries reading it, he becomes instantly paralyzed
- From the note, we learn:
	- The people that lived in this house were part of a cult that attempted to worship [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]]
		- [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] mocked them for this
	- They tortured and killed people in their dungeon and "on their hidden alter"
	- [[Gustav Durst]] had a stillborn child with another woman
	- The handwriting on this letter is the same as the letter that was brought to the party at the bar by [[Arrigal]]
- After learning this information, the party climbs to the third floor, intent on finding this baby once and for all
	- but they're met at the top of the stairs by an animate suit of armor who proved to be a tough foe
	- The party nearly finished it off as they grouped up to push it over the railing, but the armor stumbled back up the stairs for one more strike on [[Pelanil]] before being dealt its final blow by [[Elora]]
- [[Anakir]] rushes in to the room with the crying baby to find no woman, but only a bundle lying in the crib
	- After mixing random elements, hoping for a [[Potion of Healing]] but only getting slop, [[Anakir]] unwraps the bundle to find no baby
- A woman stirs on the bed in the other room
	- She screams and attacks [[Anakir]], knocking him uncons
