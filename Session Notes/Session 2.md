[[Anakir]], [[Elora]], [[Shalooti]], [[Pelanil]], [[Bardolf]]

- The party shortly question the kids outside of the House
	- We learn that their names are Rose and Thorn
- As we enter the house, the party sees that the place is immaculate but shrouded in darkness
	- Floors well oiled and the furniture freshly dusted
	- Doors seem to be opening and closing on their own
	- The stuffed wolves seem to be watching us
	- The ornate carvings in the wood paneling is not always as it seems
- Shortly after entering, the party splits up
	- [[Anakir]] and [[Pelanil]] run upstairs, chasing the sound of a harpsicord
	- The rest of the group stays on the first floor as [[Bardolf]] searches for loot
		- [[Bardolf]], taken by the quality of the dining room drapes, tears them to shreds as he tries to cut them down. He pockets the silverware instead
	- [[Shalooti]] explores a room full of stuffed wolves, and finds herself a deck of playing cards, but runs out of the room before she can unlock the other cabinet with the crossbows
- As [[Pelanil]] and [[Anakir]] reach the second floor, the sound of the harpsicord is soon replaced by that of a wailing child
	- [[Anakir]] attacks a completely ordinary suit of armor, unable to take its spear
	- They stop halfway to the third floor as they hear footsteps and a woman shushing the baby
	- [[Anakir]] sends a message to [[Elora]] telling her that they know where the baby is, but her response is cut off by maniacal laughing
		- Instead of his second message, [[Elora]] hears heavy breathing
		- and upon trying to contact the woman upstairs, [[Anakir]] senses his message has been redirected miles away where a man answers and says he looks forward to meeting him
- The party regroups on the third floor
