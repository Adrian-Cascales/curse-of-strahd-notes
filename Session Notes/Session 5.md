## Blood on the Vine Tavern
After meeting up at the [[Village of Barovia (E)#Blood of the Vine Tavern (E2)|Blood of the Vine Tavern]], the party order wine from [[Arik Lorensk|Arik the Barkeep]] who doesn't seem to be completely there. [[Bardolf]] volunteers to buy a round for the entire group.

Suspicious because of their resemblance to [[Arrigal]] who first delivered the fake letter, [[Pelanil]] approaches the three [[Vistani]] women sitting near the door to learn more about them. He tells them about the party's escape from [[Death House]] and asks why they're dressed the way they are.

We learn that the women actually own the tavern, and take offense to [[Pelanil]]'s questions. As the conversation between [[Pelanil]] and the [[Vistani]] women gets heated, the man sitting alone in the corner of the bar steps in.

[[Ismark Kolyanovich]] invites the party to join him at his table. He overheard them talking about their experience with [[Death House]] and is impressed. He really thinks that they may be able to help him and his sister with a problem their having. From [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]], we learn the following:
- For some reason, [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] is attracted to [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] and desires her above all others
- The women in the corner are [[Vistani]] spies for [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]]
