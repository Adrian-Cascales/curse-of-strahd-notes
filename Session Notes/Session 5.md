## Blood on the Vine Tavern
After meeting up at the [[Village of Barovia (E)#Blood of the Vine Tavern (E2)|Blood of the Vine Tavern]], the party order wine from [[Arik Lorensk|Arik the Barkeep]] who doesn't seem to be completely there. [[Bardolf]] volunteers to buy a round for the entire group.

### The Vistani Owners
Suspicious because of their resemblance to [[Arrigal]] who first delivered the fake letter, [[Pelanil]] approaches the three [[Vistani]] women sitting near the door to learn more about them. He tells them about the party's escape from [[Death House]] and asks why they're dressed the way they are.

The [[Vistani]] women see [[Pelanil]]'s pie from [[Morgantha|Granny]] and say they don't indulge in such things. We learn that the women actually own the tavern, and take offense to [[Pelanil]]'s questions. As the conversation between [[Pelanil]] and the [[Vistani]] women gets heated, the man sitting alone in the corner of the bar steps in.

### Meeting Ismark
[[Ismark Kolyanovich]] invites the party to join him at his table. He overheard them talking about their experience with [[Death House]] and is impressed. He really thinks that they may be able to help him and his sister with a problem their having. From [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]], we learn the following:
- [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] is the son of [[Kolyan Indirovich|Burgomaster Indirovich]]
- For some reason, [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] is attracted to his sister, [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] and desires her above all others
- The women in the corner are [[Vistani]] spies for [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]]
- [[Strahd Von Zarovich]] is a vampire, and he dwells in [[Castle Ravenloft (K)|Castle Ravenloft]]
- [[Arik Lorensk|Arik the Barkeep]] acts the way he does because he is "mist-touched"
- Wine is the only strong drink found in Barovia, and the grapes barely grow
	- All the wine comes from the [[Wizard of the Wines]] winery near [[Krezk (S)|Krezk]]
- [[Lancelot]] is actually [[Gertruda]]'s childhood pet, but she recently went missing
	- Her mother, [[Mad Mary|Mary Swilova]], has recently gone mad because of the disappearance of her daughter
- The first letter the party received from [[Arrigal]] is not in [[Kolyan Indirovich|Burgomaster Indirovich]]'s handwriting, but the one they found on the corpse is his father's

When the party presses for more details on [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]]'s and [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]]'s situation, [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] recommends they continue speaking at the [[Village of Barovia (E)#Burgomaster's Mansion (E4)|Burgomaster's Mansion]] for privacy's sake as he indicates towards the [[Vistani]] spies in the corner.

[[Shalooti]], having been performing for the small crowd, elicits applause from [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] who says that it's rare for there to be such joyful music in this dreary place.

[[Pelanil]] makes a scene, acting as if he will not help [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] and [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]], and leaves the tavern, secretly heading toward the mansion.

## The Burgomaster's Mansion
Arriving first at the mansion, [[Pelanil]] sees that there are claw marks on the walls, the windows are boarded up, and that the weeds around the house have been trampled. He knocks on the door, and a young woman peeks through the peephole and asks who's there. [[Pelanil]] explains his intentions to help and his meeting with [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]], but [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]], who seems to be terrified of strangers, does not believe him and asks him to leave.

Very soon after, the rest of the party arrives with [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] who [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] is happy to let inside. [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] explains the party's experience with [[Death House]] and tells [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] that they may be capable of getting her to safety.

Upon entering the house, the party sees [[Kolyan Indirovich|Burgomaster Indirovich]]'s corpse in a wooden coffin with wilted flowers and the scent of decay surrounding it. [[Pelanil]] does a little magic to bring the flowers back to life, and noticing the absence of a cross among the various religious iconography around the house, offers one to [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] while he spreads the gospel of the half-elf [[Jesus]] from the village of [[Nazareth]].

From [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] and [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] we learn:
- [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] has bitten [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] twice within a fortnight
	- She doesn't remember much about her encounters with [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] though
- [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] doesn't seem to be able to enter residences without invitation
- [[Kolyan Indirovich|Burgomaster Indirovich]] died from a heart attack after wolves and other terrible creatures under [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]]'s command attacked the house night after night
- [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] has taken multiple consorts, but ultimately turned them into vampire spawn
- Others have stormed [[Castle Ravenloft (K)|Castle Ravenloft]], only to have been killed or turned by [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]]
	- Notably, [[Donavich]]'s son [[Doru]]
- Moving [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] is a gamble, but [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] hears that [[Vallaki (N)]] is well guarded and ultimately worth the risk
- Anyone who attempts to leave the land of Barovia begins to choke on the fog
	- Those who don't turn back perish


[[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] offers the party 50gp to transport [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]], and they agree to do so. The party is ready to set out at once, but [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] refuses to leave until she see's her father properly laid to rest in the village cemetery. [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] recommends the party leave first thing in the morning to carry the body to [[Donavich]] at the church.

Just to make sure things were in order, [[Bardolf]] and [[Pelanil]] head to the church that evening to inform [[Donavich]] that they'll be back first thing tomorrow for a funeral. They find [[Donavich]] exhausted and hoarse from praying all day for his son [[Doru]] who was apparently turned by [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] when he attempted to storm [[Ravenloft]].

### Some Long-Deserved Rest
All back at the mansion, the party lie down for the night. They all have the same exact dream of a woman asking them to join her at [[Tser Pool Encampment (G)|Tser Pool]] for a card reading saying that their distance has rendered her "Sight blurred and obscured."

All the party members except for [[Pelanil]] had the most wonderful, peaceful sleep they'd ever experienced, only to wake feeling drained and incredibly sad.
