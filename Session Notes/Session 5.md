## Blood on the Vine Tavern
After meeting up at the [[Village of Barovia (E)#Blood of the Vine Tavern (E2)|Blood of the Vine Tavern]], the party order wine from [[Arik Lorensk|Arik the Barkeep]] who doesn't seem to be completely there. [[Bardolf]] volunteers to buy a round for the entire group.

### The Vistani Owners
Suspicious because of their resemblance to [[Arrigal]] who first delivered the fake letter, [[Pelanil]] approaches the three [[Vistani]] women sitting near the door to learn more about them. He tells them about the party's escape from [[Death House]] and asks why they're dressed the way they are.

The [[Vistani]] women see [[Pelanil]]'s pie from [[Morgantha|Granny]] and say they don't indulge in such things. We learn that the women actually own the tavern, and take offense to [[Pelanil]]'s questions. As the conversation between [[Pelanil]] and the [[Vistani]] women gets heated, the man sitting alone in the corner of the bar steps in.

### Meeting Ismark
[[Ismark Kolyanovich]] invites the party to join him at his table. He overheard them talking about their experience with [[Death House]] and is impressed. He really thinks that they may be able to help him and his sister with a problem their having. From [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]], we learn the following:
- [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] is the son of [[Kolyan Indirovich|Burgomaster Indirovich]]
- For some reason, [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] is attracted to his sister, [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] and desires her above all others
- The women in the corner are [[Vistani]] spies for [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]]
- [[Strahd Von Zarovich]] is a vampire, and he dwells in [[Castle Ravenloft (K)]]
- [[Arik Lorensk|Arik the Barkeep]] acts the way he does because he is "mist-touched"
- Wine is the only strong drink found in Barovia, and the grapes barely grow
	- All the wine comes from the [[Wizard of the Wines]] winery near [[Krezk (S)|Krezk]]
- [[Lancelot]] is actually [[Gertruda]]'s childhood pet, but she recently went missing
	- Her mother, [[Mad Mary|Mary Swilova]], has recently gone mad because of the disappearance of her daughter

When the party presses for more details on [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]]'s and [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]]'s situation, [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] recommends they continue speaking at the [[Village of Barovia (E)#Burgomaster's Mansion (E4)|Burgomaster's Mansion]] for privacy's sake as he indicates towards the [[Vistani]] spies in the corner.

[[Shalooti]], having been performing for the small crowd, elicits applause from [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] who says that it's rare for there to be such joyful music in this dreary place.

[[Pelanil]] makes a scene, acting as if he will not help [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] and [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]], and leaves the tavern, secretly heading toward the mansion.

## The Burgomaster's Mansion
Arriving first at the mansion, [[Pelanil]] sees that there are claw marks on the walls and that the weeds around the house have been trampled. He knocks on the door, and a young woman peeks through the peephole and asks who's there. [[Pelanil]] explains his intentions to help and his meeting with [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]], but [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]], who seems to be terrified of strangers, does not believe him and asks him to leave.

Very soon after, the rest of the party arrives ti

- Moving [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] is a gamble, but [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] hears that [[Vallaki]] is well gaurded
