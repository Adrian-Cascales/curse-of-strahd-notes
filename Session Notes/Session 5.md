## Blood on the Vine Tavern
After meeting up at the [[Village of Barovia (E)#Blood of the Vine Tavern (E2)|Blood of the Vine Tavern]], the party order wine from [[Arik Lorensk|Arik the Barkeep]] who doesn't seem to be completely there.

Suspicious because of their resemblance to [[Arrigal]] who first delivered the fake letter, [[Pelanil]] approaches the three [[Vistani]] women sitting near the door to learn more about them. He tells them about the party's escape from [[Death House]] and asks why they're dressed the way they are.

Before they can
