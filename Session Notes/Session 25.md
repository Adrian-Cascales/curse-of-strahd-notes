## Pups and Hairy Men

As the party makes their way out of [[Yester Hill]] back towards [[The Wizard of Wines (W)|The Winery]], they notice that the wolves seem to stop howling.

A few minutes down the road, they come across a large man with mutton chops. [[Shalooti]] notices [[Lancelot Stat Block]] trying to play with some scared looking wolf pups on the side of the road, and she stops to give them jerky.

The man whistles for the pups, and they retreat back to him. The party continues on past the man who warily eye the group as they pass.

Another 30 minutes on the road, and [[Bardolf]] notices movement behind them. Suddenly, 2 dire wolves jump from the woods and attack, followed shortly by the same man who transforms into a wolf-human hybrid. Two other werewolves join the fight, and one commands the pups, names [[Lazlo]], [[Hans]], and [[Franz]] to attack. They hesitate but ultimately bite at [[Shalooti]].

[[Bardolf]] is bitten by one of the werewolves and notices that it stings a bit more than normal.

Realizing the wolf pups are likely the same boys missing from the [[The Town of Vallaki (N)|Vallaki]] orphanage, [[Anakir]] puts them to sleep to avoid causing them any harm. The rest of the party dispatches the dire wolves and the werewolves. They give the boys -- now in human form, naked, and awake -- the animal pelts to wear and escort them back to [[The Wizard of Wines (W)|The Winery]].


## Lunch with the Martikovs

Back at [[The Wizard of Wines (W)|The Wizard of Wines]], the group is met by an eager [[Adrian Martikov]]. Asking too soon about the gem, [[Pelanil]] punches him twice before he drops the matter and invites everyone in for lunch.

The boys tell the group about how they were kidnapped after running away from the orphanage. The said that the werewolves took them to their den somewhere out in the middle of the woods, where they locked them in cages and forced them to fight other kids for the opportunity to be turned in to werewolves.

[[Davian Martikov|Davian]] congratulates [[Bardolf]] on his newly-obtained [[Lycanthropy]], remembering that just yesterday, [[Bardolf]] was asking to be turned into a wereraven. [[Davian Martikov|Davian]] goes on to explain that there are three ways for [[Lycanthropy]] to be removed:
1. A [[Greater Restoration]] spell, known by only very powerful magic practitioners
2. Killing the root lycanthrope - [[Davian Martikov|Davian]] had heard of this happening in distant history, but has never seen it himself
3. Belladonna Root Treatment - a very dangerous poison that is just as likely to kill the patient as to heal them of their curse
	1. The group considered where the could find the root:
		1. Maybe the [[Mad Mage of Mount Baratok|Mad Mage]] has found some living in the woods
		2. Since [[Baba Lysaga]] is into natural magic, maybe she has some stored up

The group decided that they would continue on to [[Ruins of Berez (U)|Berez]] to [[Quests#^4a4e62|find the second gem]], [[Quests#^cd99e4|recover Argynost's skull]], and [[Quests#^56b12b|find some Belladonna root to cure Bardolf]].

## The Gem and Prepping for the Night
The party finally agreed to give up the gem for a stake in [[The Wizard of Wines (W)|The Winery]]. [[Adrian Martikov|Adrian]] agreed to give:
- 10% for the first gem
- 25% for the second gem
- 80% for the third gem

[[Dag Tomescu|Dag]] immediately took the gem out to the vineyard and buried it.

The group asked how they could protect [[Bardolf]] if he were to turn overnight. [[Davian Martikov|Davian]] offered a large chain and a pillar in the cellar to tie him to.
