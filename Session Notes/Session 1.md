[[Anakir]], [[Elora]], [[Shalooti]], [[Pelanil]], [[Bordaulf]]

- We started in a bar just west of Phandalin
	- There we met Taako and Barry playing Taako's made up game Taakala
	- [[Anakir]] lost 2 sp to [[Elora]] and also mysteriously lost another 13 sp
	- [[Pelanil]] did a lot of glaring a folks, and then after finding out that Barry was lich, picked a fight which Taako tried to diffuse
- The Characters received a letter via the messenger [[Arrigal]] that was addressed to each of them individually and signed the [[Kolyan Indirovich]], Burgomaster of Barovia
- The group stayed the night at the tavern, then at first light made their way west per [[Arrigal]]'s directions
- As the fog closed in, [[Pelanil]] was struck by a vision of a woman beckoning him
- As the fog cleared, the party was surprised to find themselves in a forest
- Continuing on the road, [[Carlos]] the mule in tow, the group caught the stench of death
	- they followed the smell off the road where they found where they found a mauled body
	- on the body, the found another note in another script, also signed by [[Kolyan Indirovich]]
	- This one is much more foreboding than the first, claiming that the Burgomaster's daughter [[Ireena Kolyana]] has been bitten by a vampire
- Right after finding the note, the party is attacked by wolves, seemingly led by a red-eyed direwolf in the distance
	- The party was able to quickly charm, kill, and put to sleep the wolves as the direwolf looked on and make it back to the road
	- [[Bordaulf]]
- After a full day of travelling, night set in as the adventurers arrived in a sleeping town
- Two children (whose names we don't know) begged for help from the party
	- saying their parents are missing, their baby brother Walter is stuck in the 3rd floor nursery, and there is a monster in the basement of their house
- The party obliges to help as the mists close in
