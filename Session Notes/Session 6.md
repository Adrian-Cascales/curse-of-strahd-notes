## The Funeral
After their well deserved rest, the party meets [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] downstairs, they each take up a spot helping carry the coffin, and make their way across town to meet [[Donavich]] for the funeral, leaving [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] at home for safety.

At the church, the party is met with some screaming, and begging for food coming from the basement.
