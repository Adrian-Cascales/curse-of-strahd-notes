## The Funeral
After their well deserved rest, the party meets [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] downstairs, they each take up a spot helping carry the coffin, and make their way across town to meet [[Donavich]] for the funeral, leaving [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] at home with [[Shalooti]] for safety.

At the church, the party is met with some screaming, and begging for food coming from the basement. [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] tells the group that this is [[Donavich]]'s son [[Doru]] who was turned by [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] a little over a year ago. [[Donavich]] keeps him locked in the basement.

After interrupting his endless praying, [[Donavich]] leads the party to the cemetery where he offers prayers to [[The Morninglord]] for [[Kolyan Indirovich]]'s deliverance from Barovia.

## [[Elora]] Meets [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]]
While the rest of the party has their heads bowed in prayer, [[Elora]] notices a shadowy figure standing outside the cemetery gates. She sneaks off from the party and approaches.

Upon greeting the man, she realizes that it's actually [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] who has come to pay respects to the late Burgomaster. [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] is surprised when [[Elora]] approaches, but quickly regains his cool. He already knows her name, but asks about her relation to the Burgomaster. He tells her that he looks forward to meeting in the future under better circumstances, then immediately turns in to a bat and flies off.

[[Donavich]] pulls [[Bardolf]] aside and begs him to take [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] far away from this village, and recommends they take her to the [[The Abbott|Abbott]] at the [[Abbey of Saint Markovia]] in [[Krezk (S)|Krezk]].

## Back at the Mansion
[[Elora]] tells the party about her encounter, and concerned for [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]]'s safety, they begin running back to the mansion. Upon arrival, they find [[Mad Mary|Mary Swilova]] banging on the door. [[Anakir]] attempts to send her a message which she interprets as voices in her head, and proceeds to become unresponsive. [[Anakir]] provides some shock therapy.

## Wrapping Up in [[Village of Barovia (E)|Barovia Village]]
[[Bardolf]] introduces the party to his brand new invention, [[Metarlos]], the metal version of [[Carlos]].
