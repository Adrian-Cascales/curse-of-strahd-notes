## The Funeral
After their well deserved rest, the party meets [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] downstairs, they each take up a spot helping carry the coffin, and make their way across town to meet [[Donavich]] for the funeral, leaving [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] at home with [[Shalooti]] for safety.

At the church, the party is met with some screaming, and begging for food coming from the basement. [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] tells the group that this is [[Donavich]]'s son [[Doru]] who was turned by [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] a little over a year ago. [[Donavich]] keeps him locked in the basement.

After interrupting his endless praying, [[Donavich]] leads the party to the cemetery where he offers prayers to [[The Morninglord]] for [[Kolyan Indirovich]]'s deliverance from Barovia.

## [[Elora]] Meets [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]]
While the rest of the party has their heads bowed in prayer, [[Elora]] notices a shadowy figure standing outside the cemetery gates. She sneaks off from the party and approaches.

Upon greeting the man, she realizes that it's actually [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] who has come to pay respects to the late Burgomaster. [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] is surprised when [[Elora]] approaches, but quickly regains his cool. He already knows her name, but asks about her relation to the Burgomaster. He tells her that he looks forward to meeting in the future under better circumstances, then immediately turns in to a bat and flies off.

[[Donavich]] pulls [[Bardolf]] aside and begs him to take [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] far away from this village, and recommends they take her to the [[The Abbott|Abbott]] at the [[Abbey of Saint Markovia]] in [[Village of Krezk (S)|Krezk]]. [[Bardolf]] swears he will get vengeance by "holding a candle under [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]]'s nuts". [[Donavich]] gives [[Bardolf]] his last candle to support his cause.

## Back at the Mansion
[[Elora]] tells the party about her encounter, and concerned for [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]]'s safety, they begin running back to the mansion. Upon arrival, they find [[Mad Mary|Mary Swilova]] banging on the door. [[Anakir]] attempts to send her a message which she interprets as voices in her head, and proceeds to become unresponsive. [[Anakir]] provides some shock therapy.

As the party is finishing up their packing, [[Anakir]] suddenly finds himself eating another pie. He tries to stop, but cannot.

## Wrapping Up in [[Village of Barovia (E)|Barovia Village]]
[[Bardolf]] introduces the party to his brand new invention, [[Metarlos]], the metal, and magically enhanced version of [[Carlos]]. [[Bardolf]] leaves [[Carlos]] with [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] who thanks him greatly, saying that if things go poorly in the village, the townsfolk will at least have some food. [[Bardolf]] warns [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] against eating [[Carlos]].

[[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] and [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] say their goodbyes, and [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] confirms that the party is on their way to [[The Town of Vallaki (N)|Vallaki]] and stopping over at [[Tser Pool Encampment (G)|Tser Pool]] for the night.

[[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] offers to take care of [[Lancelot]] since travelling is not safe for house-raised pets, but [[Shalooti]] insists that [[Lancelot]] will do just fine on the road.

## On the Road
The party leaves [[Village of Barovia (E)|Barovia Village]] and makes their way toward [[Tser Pool Encampment (G)|Tser Pool]].

They come to a fork in the road that has a gallows and graveyard off to the side. Upon inspecting the graves, [[Bardolf]] finds 11 blank tombstones, one of which he engraves in memory of his father. [[Bardolf]] is also surprised to see the he himself now hangs in the once empty gallows.

After a quick break, the party then continues their journey toward [[Tser Pool Encampment (G)|Tser Pool]]. Nearing the end, [[Pelanil]] notices wolves lurking in the woods. The party is able to quickly dispatch them all, with only [[Pelanil]] taking damage. We learn that [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] is trained with the rapier, but is not all that great. Regardless, she's incredibly set on helping the party the best she can.

## [[Tser Pool Encampment (G)|Tser Pool]]
In early evening, the party arrives at the outskirt of the [[Vistani]] camp at [[Tser Pool Encampment (G)|Tser Pool]]. [[Shalooti]] immediately runs up to the fire to roast the wolf leg she harvested for [[Lancelot]]. The party is met by an intoxicated [[Arahja]], a [[Vistani|Vistana]] who does not seem at all like the others they have encountered thus far. He encourages the group to go see [[Madam Eva]].

## [[Madam Eva]]'s Card Reading
[[Madam Eva]] calls out to the party before they enter the tent, and when they do, she addresses each of them by name. She asks if the party would like to know their future, and they agree to a tarokka reading.

[[Madam Eva]] rolls out a sheet of black velvet on her table, takes out a crystal ball, and a deck of cards. She splits the cards into two piles and explains that one deck is the common deck and one deck is the high deck.

She draws the following cards and gives the corresponding descriptions:
- 7 of Stars -- Illusionist
>This card tells of history. Knowledge of the ancient will help you better understand your enemy.
>A man is not what he seems. He comes here in a carnival wagon. Therein lies what you seek.

- 1 of Swords -- Avenger
>This card tells of a powerful force for good and protection, a holy symbol of great hope.
>The treasure lies in a dragon's house, in hands once clean and now corrupted.

- 8 of Glyphs -- Bishop
>This is a card of power and strength. It tells of a weapon of vengeance: a sword of sunlight
>What you seek lies in a pile of treasure, beyond a set of amber doors

- Broken One 
>This card sheds light on one who will help you greatly in the battle against darkness.
>Your greatest ally will be a wizard. His mind is broken, but his spells are strong

- Innocent
>Your enemy is a creature of darkness, whose powers are beyond mortality. This card will lead you to him!
>He dwells with the one whose blood sealed his doom, a brother of light snuffed out too soon.
