## The Keepers of the Feather
[[Danika Dorakova|Danika]] and [[Urwin Martikov|Urwin]] Martikov revealed themselves to be members of [[The Keepers of the Feather|Keepers of the Feather]]. They and their comrades are all wereravens and run a spy network to collect intelligence on [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] and his minions. They told the party:
- [[The Abbot]] is able to bring [[Pelanil]] back to life
	- but he "has a penchant for the grotesque"
	- Most likely, this is where [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] is currently taking [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]]
- The party doesn't stand a chance against [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] at the moment
	- their best option is to gather allies and grow their strength
- They were the ones that helped the party out at [[Old Bonegrinder (O)|Old Bonegrinder]]
- They have seen the [[Mad Mage of Mount Baratok|Mad Mage]] on the banks of [[Lake Zarovich (L)|Lake Zarovich]] at the base of [[Mount Baratok (M)|Mount Baratok]]

[[Bardolf]] asks if they would bite him and turn him into a wereraven. They give him a pamphlet on lycanthropy so that he can provide informed consent, but [[Bardolf]] declines the procedure after better understanding the risks.

## Pelanil Returns
[[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] comes running upstairs yelling for the party. He tells them that there is something wrong with [[Pelanil]].

The whole party runs downstairs to find [[Pelanil]] sitting up, alive. His once gray hair is now snow white and thin, his green eyes gray, and his skin incredibly pale.

He remembers [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] killing him, his spirit leaving his body and floating through Barovia searching for an escape, and the mist acting as a solid barrier for his soul. He prayed to his deity, [[Jesus|Jesus Christ of Nazareth]], but was still unable to pass through. A shadow in the mists asked [[Pelanil]] some unknown question, and [[Pelanil]] agreed only to wake again inside the [[The Town of Vallaki (N)#Blue Water Inn (N2)|Blue Water Inn]].

The party questions [[Pelanil]] on what happened to him, and many distrust that their old friend is still sane or good. [[Pelanil]], his whole belief system upended, goes on a long walk around a quiet [[The Town of Vallaki (N)|Vallaki]].

[[Pelanil's NDE]]

## Izek and Elora, Siblings Reunited
[[Izek Strazni|Izek]] explains their family's history to Elora:
- Their distant ancestors are the Dursts from [[Death House]]
	- The evil they conjured in that house caused a demonic stain on their bloodline
	- Every so often, children in the family are born with deformities ([[Izek Strazni|Izek]]'s arm and [[Elora]]'s tail)
- Their parents tried to hide [[Izek Strazni|Izek]]'s arm, but one day it finally slipped to the wrong person
	- That person threatened to tell the Burgomaster whose strict laws would likely lead to imprisonment
- The family fled, but were attacked by wolves in the woods, and the parents died
	- [[Izek Strazni|Izek]] was found by someone who took him to [[Vargas Vallakovich]] who pitied him
	- [[Izek Strazni|Izek]] came back looking for [[Elora]], but she was gone
- [[Vargas Vallakovich|Baron Vallakovich]] raised [[Izek Strazni|Izek]] like his own son, so [[Izek Strazni|Izek]] feels somewhat bound to fulfill his duty to [[Vargas Vallakovich|The Burgomaster]]
	- He's not as violent as people assume
	- But the perception is useful in performing his job
- [[Izek Strazni|Izek]], since he was a child, has had recurring dreams of [[Elora]] wherein she aged in real time
	- This is how he was able to have the dolls made

[[Elora]] tells [[Izek Strazni|Izek]] that the doll thing is weird and that he should stop. [[Izek Strazni|Izek]] said he never threatened [[Gadof Blinsky|Blinsky]], but the man made the dolls for free out of fear. [[Izek Strazni|Izek]] invites [[Elora]] to meet [[Vargas Vallakovich|Vargas]].

## Carlos Returns
The wolf hunters come back to the Inn to return [[Carlos]] to [[Bardolf]]. After being paid, they also give [[Bardolf]] two letters: [[Strahd's Invitation]] and [[Ismark's Letter]].

## The Orphanage and the Lake
After a long rest, the party wakes up the next morning to the smell of bacon. [[Anakir]] has terrible nightmares, but his pie cravings seem to be subsiding. He no longer has disadvantage on skill checks.

Before they leave the Inn, a crier brings news that the [[The Town of Vallaki (N)#Festival of the Blazing Sun|Festival of the Blazing Sun]] has been moved up to this afternoon. [[Bardolf]] strikes the crier with his hammer, knocking him unconscious. [[Brom Martikova|Brom]] and [[Bray Martikov|Bray]] drag the man into a back room and gag him.

The party decides to go looking for [[Milivoj]] to appease [[Anakir]], but in the rubble that used to be the orphanage, they can't find him. They make their way towards [[Lake Zarovich (L)|Lake Zarovich]].

Once at the lake, they see a boat out in the middle of the water and a man sitting inside with a fishing rod. Assuming this is the [[Mad Mage of Mount Baratok|Mad Mage]] the are looking for, they row out to meet him, [[Pelanil]] in his own boat, [[Anakir]], [[Shalooti]], and [[Elora]] in another. [[Bardolf]] stays behind to try his hand at hammer fishing, but the fish aren't biting.

Once closer, [[Pelanil]] recognizes that the man has a large, moving burlap sack that he tosses into the water. He asks the man, [[Bluto]], what he's fishing for to which he responds "fish". [[Pelanil]] jumps in after the sack, but is unable to reach it on his first attempt. On his second try, he pulls the bag into his boat and tears it open. Inside is a 7-year-old [[Vistani]] girl, [[Arabelle]]. She asks to be taken back to her family in the camp just south of [[The Town of Vallaki (N)|Vallaki]].

[[Pelanil]] jumps into the boat with [[Bluto]] and slits his throat.

## The Mad Mage
As they're headed back to the southern shore of the lake to meet [[Bardolf]], they see, on the northern bank, an elk transform into a man in black robes. Sure that this is in fact their wizard, the party head towards him and tell [[Bardolf]] to catch up.

[[Bardolf]] rides [[Metarlos]] around the lake and through its tributary to the other side.

[[Arabelle]] is not happy that the party is not taking her back to her camp. Fed up with her attitude, [[Anakir]] charms her and tells her to go get all the money her family has and bring it back to the party. When her boat reaches the shore, she takes it directly back to the other side by herself. [[Anakir]] leaves a note.

[[Pelanil]] is the first to reach the man. Scared, he starts running for the woods and shooting firebolts at [[Pelanil]]. The rest of the crew finally catch up. [[Elora]] is able to swing from the trees with her tail and head him off in the woods. Surrounded, he relents.

At first he doesn't know his name, nor does he have any information for the party. With some successful arcana checks, the party realizes he's under the effects of a [[Mind Blank]] spell. With this information, he's able to end the spell he cast on himself.

![[mad mage.png|200]]

He reveals himself as the great and powerful, [[Mad Mage of Mount Baratok|Mordenkainen]], an archmage of Oerth and the leader of a powerful group of adventurers called the Circle of Eight. He came to Barovia more than a year ago to free its people from [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]]'s tyranny, but he underestimated [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]]'s hold over the land and the creatures in it. After a battle between the two in [[Castle Ravenloft (K)|Castle Ravenloft]], [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] drove the [[Mad Mage of Mount Baratok|Mad Mage]] to the mountains and sent the wizard hurling over [[Tser Falls (H)|Tser Falls]]. The wizard, his staff and spellbook lost, survived the fall and retreated into the mountains, hoping to regain his power, only to be driven mad by the realization that he no longer has any hope of defeating [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] or freeing the people of the vampire's damned realm.

He leads the party to his mansion in the woods, which is actually a [[Mordenkainen's Magnificent Mansion]] spell, an extradimensional dwelling that is very large on the inside. He tells the party there that he is not able to join them on their journey, but that when they are ready to take on [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]], he is willing to assist them in battle.

## Back to Vallaki
Having recruited the somewhat loopy [[Mad Mage of Mount Baratok|Mordenkainen]], the party is ready to head toward [[Argynvostholt (Q)|Argynvostholt]]. They make their way into [[The Town of Vallaki (N)|Vallaki]] to follow the road west. The guards at the gate tell them the festival is about to begin and insist on escorting them. The party refuses to go, and just as things are about to turn violent, [[Izek Strazni|Izek]] shows up and diffuses the situation.

The party is able to convince him that they don't need to go to the festival. He agrees to come with [[Elora]] even though he is torn about leaving the only father-figure he's ever known. The party makes their way towards the eastern gate.
