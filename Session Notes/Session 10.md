## Wrapping up at the Windmill
After finishing a short rest near the megaliths, the party questions the children about their predicament. We learn:
- [[Myrtle]] says [[Freek]] doesn't have a soul
	- like many other Barovians, he was born as only a shell
	- when people die in Barovia, their souls are unable to escape, and they inherit new bodies
	- [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] says it's just a tall tale passed around by children, but that these people have been mist-touched
	- [[Myrtle]] disagrees, and [[Lucien]] says he's known [[Freek]] his whole life, and he's always been that way

The party catches a glance of [[Elora]]'s tail, something she's dealt with her whole life, but has tried to keep a secret.

[[Shalooti]] convinces the party to help her dig through the windmill rubble to find some more of the youth potion that was thrown on the hags. The group obliges, and the party dig around for an hour. [[Elora]] was the only one lucky enough to find anything, but she found quite a bit, including a [[Pale Tincture (Ingested)|Pale Tincture]].

After all that, the party hits the road, and after 2.5 hours make it to [[The Town of Vallaki (N)|Vallaki]] with no more excitement on the road.

## Vallaki Gate
Upon approaching, the party are interrogated by the guards. [[Shalooti]] convinces the guards to let her in, agreeing to do a show. [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] blows her cover after failing to convince the guards of her fake name. The Vallakian law is read:
- No one shall speak Strahd's name out loud or carry written documents with his name on them
- No one shall speak poorly of the Baron or the festivals nor hold any documents that present either in an ill light
- Everyone shall take part in preparing the festivals
	- But visitors are exempt
- Everyone shall attend the festivals, no exceptions

Other things learned at the gate:
- The burgomaster, [[Vargas Vallakovich|Baron Vargas Vallakovich]], has decreed that the [[Festival of the Blazing Sun]] will be held in the town square in three days
	- The previous festival, which he called the [[Wolf's Head Jamboree]], was less than a week ago
	- While the guards only speak positively of the festivals, their tone hints otherwise
- [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] hasn't visited [[The Town of Vallaki (N)|Vallaki]] in over 100 years

Everyone registers their weapons, although [[Pelanil]] is able to cover for [[Anakir]]'s failed lie by telling the guards his name is [[Anakir|Asvir Ravenclaw]].

The scribe noting down the registered weapons thinks [[Elora]] looks familiar, and [[Alana]], one of the other guards offers to take the children to the orphanage. Although [[Shalooti]] and [[Anakir]] are initially wary, they eventually come to believe that she means the children no harm.

Once inside the gates, the party is a bit shocked to see that the town is bustling, and people are actually maybe a little happy.

## Shopping
[[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] seems a bit excited to split off from the party, but won't say where she's going. Later, [[Elora]], [[Shalooti]], and [[Anakir]] find her buying healers kits from the apothecary. She claims she only ever learned "hobbies appropriate for a lady" growing up in the Burgomaster's mansion, but now she thinks she can lean on her sewing skills to learn to heal people.

[[Bardolf]] and [[Pelanil]] head to the Blacksmith and Leatherworker. [[Pelanil]] does a lot of bargaining, ultimately promising the shopkeeper [[Shalooti]] tickets to get some new half plate. [[Bardolf]] buys a saddle.

## The Town Square
On the way to the Inn, [[Anakir]], [[Shalooti]], and [[Elora]] pass through the town square. There they see men women and children on a stage in the middle of the square, in stocks and wearing plaster donkey heads. [[Elora]] learns it's because of their "malicious unhappiness".

The party see that some old proclamations detailing _The Wolf's Head Jamboree_ being taken down and new ones about _The Festival of the Blazing Sun_ being put up.

## The Blue Water Inn
Everyone meets back up at the Inn. We all meet the bartender [[Danika Dorakova|Danika]] and her husband [[Urwin Martikov|Urwin]]. [[Bardolf]] is looking for someone to go fetch [[Carlos]], but [[Danika Dorakova|Danika]] says the hunters that have been frequenting the bar have recently been away.

She also says that [[Urwin Martikov|Urwin]]'s father owns the [[The Wizard of Wines (W)|Wizard of Wines]], though they aren't on speaking terms.

[[Urwin Martikov|Urwin]] recognizes [[Shalooti]], so she performs for the crowd and earns the party a night's stay at the inn (she of course gets her own room).

Just as she finishes her performance, [[Rictavio]] the carnival ringmaster comes down the stairs, and everyone cheers, hoping for another story.
