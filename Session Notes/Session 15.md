## Strahd's Monologue
Once he has the bones in hand, [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] proceeds to go on about [[St Andral]] while the party heckles him. Unperturbed, he tells the story of how [[St Andral|Andral]] was once one of his men. When [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] first gained immortality after [[Tatyana]] flung herself from the castle walls, [[St Andral|Andral]] was the guard who shot him in the back. [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] pursued, only to find [[St Andral|Andral]] and his counterparts holed up inside the house that once stood on these grounds. Unable to enter without an invite, [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] was never able to punish [[St Andral|Andral]] for his cowardice. And with the protection the bones of [[St Andral]] provided to the church, [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] was never able to enter.

Now, [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] says, without the bones, this church can no longer resist him, and he fireballs the bones into ashes.

## Ireena
With the brightness of the blast as cover, [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] is able to run past the party and scoop up [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]]. As he carries her toward the door, [[Pelanil]] is completely convinced that her fate is to be turned by [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] and live out her life as yet another of his evil consorts.

[[Pelanil]] musters every bit of courage he has, and against all his instincts, blasts [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] with guiding bolt. Still psychically linked with [[Elora]], his mind roars with agony as he performs the difficult but merciful deed.

Given a quick death, -- a welcome alternative to the living hell she would most certainly otherwise endure -- [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] goes limp in [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]]'s arms. [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] gently lays her body on the ground and whispers "[[Tatyana]]". He turns his full attention to [[Pelanil]].

## Pelanil
Still reeling from the reality of the decision he was forced to make, [[Pelanil]] sees that [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]]'s full attention is now on him. [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] raises his hand and mutters some words as [[Pelanil]] feels a necromantic energy wash over him, draining all the vitality from his body. [[Pelanil]] falls flat, his body withered and lifeless.

Still processing these events, the party sees [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] touch [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]], and then both disappear. Seconds later, they see what seems to be a rider-less [[Beucephalus]] take flight towards [[Castle Ravenloft (K)|Castle Ravenloft]] as the vampire spawn once again embrace disorder. They set fire to the sanctuary and dart into the streets once again.

[[Elora]], briefly expressing her grief before rushing into action, places her look-alike doll in his lifeless hands.

## The Fire
The party and [[Izek Strazni|Izek]] rush into action to save the parishioners at the church and the children at the orphanage before the fire can spread too far. They're able to save [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]], [[Yeska]], [[Freek]], [[Myrtle]], and [[Pelanil]]'s corpse before the fires close in. Multiple other children as well as [[Ms Belasco|Dr Velasco]] perish in the blaze.

Inspired by their heroism, the town guards and bystanders rush in to extinguish the flames before they are able to consume the entire town.

[[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] offers the party [[St Andral's Votive Candle]] for rescuing him and the children.

## Danika
Dazed from their losses, the party find themselves wandering the streets of [[The Town of Vallaki (N)|Vallaki]], contemplating leaving town immediately. They're approached by [[Danika Dorakova|Danika Martikov]] who is saddened to see [[Pelanil]]'s body being carried by [[Metarlos]]. She offers the party a safe place to rest after their encounter, and upon learning [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] had died, tells them that she left a package for them.

Back at the [[The Town of Vallaki (N)#Blue Water Inn (N2)|Blue Water Inn]], [[Danika Dorakova|Danika]] gives [[Shalooti]] a wrapped package. She says that [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] had a bad feeling about her safety, and left the package should something happen to her. Inside, the party found a 6 healers kits as well as a needlepoint for each person:
- a cross for [[Pelanil]]
- a rock donkey for [[Bardolf]]
- a butt flute for [[Shalooti]]
- a pride flag for [[Anakir]] (she must have made it right after the toy store)
- [[Elora]]'s is the most striking, showing obvious skill. She must have worked for hours on it
	- It's a detailed portrait of [[Elora]], tail included, and even prominent. And in this depiction, the tail is very ornate and quite beautiful.
	- And embroidered below the image the words, "Never be ashamed of who you are"

[[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] mentions that there is a rumor that [[The Abbott]] at the [[Abbey of Saint Markovia]] in [[Village of Krezk (S)|Krezk]] has been able to bring someone back to life. At this news, [[Danika Dorakova|Danika]] asks the party to come upstairs to talk with her and her husband, [[Urwin Martikov|Urwin]]. The group follows and leaves [[Pelanil]]'s body with the priest for him to tend to.

Upstairs, [[Danika Dorakova|Danika]] leads the groups into a secret room where [[Urwin Martikov|Urwin]] and a couple other people wait. Inside she tells the party that what she's about to tell them may sound incredulous, but that she would like to provide them proof that they can trust her.

[[Danika Dorakova|Danika]] spreads out her arms, her face grows feathers, and her body shrinks as she transforms into a raven.
