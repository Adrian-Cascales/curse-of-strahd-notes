## The Mist
[[Shalooti]] pulls as hard as she can, but it's not quite enough. She slows [[Pelanil]] down, but he continues moving into the mists. [[Metarlos]] bites onto [[Elora]]'s butt cheeks to help pull, but [[Elora]] is caught off guard, and the bite causes her to lose her grip. [[Pelanil]] is pulled further, all the way into the mist.

## Menigal, The Departed
Finally, [[Pelanil]] can see clearly the dark figure in the mist. [[Menigal, the Departed|Menigal]] asks [[Pelanil]] why he has returned to him without completing his side of their bargain. [[Pelanil]] doesn't remember ever meeting [[Menigal, the Departed|Menigal]].

![[menigal.jpg|400]]

[[Menigal, the Departed]] refreshes [[Pelanil]]'s memory of their last conversation:
- He is one of the [[Dark Powers]] that coalesce in the [[Domains of Dread]]
- When the [[Shadowfell]] was created, the [[Demiplane of Dread]] fragmented
- Each Darklord's realm settled into a spot somewhere within the new plane
	- [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]]'s realm has settled here
- [[Vampyr]] is another dark power; he gave [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] his immortality
- Each [[Dark Powers|Dark Power]] likes a specific kind of soul
	- [[Vampyr]] collects those of people who died of exsanguination (blood loss)
	- [[Menigal, the Departed|Menigal]] likes souls that died of _any_ unnatural cause
- [[Menigal, the Departed|Menigal]] is tired of [[Vampyr]] getting all the souls in the valley
	- he wants [[Pelanil]]'s help collecting them

[[Pelanil]] tells [[Menigal, the Departed|Menigal]] that he doesn't remember their pact ([[Pelanil's NDE]]). [[Menigal, the Departed|Menigal]] touches [[Pelanil]]'s head and bids him to remember.

## Meanwhile
While this conversation takes no more than a couple minutes, outside the mist, much more time passes. The party waits, but there is no sign of their friend. [[Anakir]] gets a rise out of the mist, and asks it to part. [[Bardolf]] sends in [[Metarlos]] to retrieve [[Pelanil]]. [[Bardolf]] also throws in a rope to try to grab [[Pelanil]]. [[Shalooti]] plays her flute with incredible emotion and conviction.

After 15 minutes of worry for [[Metarlos]] and [[Pelanil]], [[Anakir]]'s request is realized as the mists part and [[Pelanil]] and [[Metarlos]] make their way out.

## Pelanil Remembers
[[Pelanil]]'s memory is restored, though he tells no one else of them. [[Menigal, the Departed|Menigal]] thanks him for "dispatching to me the soul of that insufferable toymaker", and offers him the [[Among the Dead Feature]].

[[Pelanil]] hears clip-clopping behind him in the mist, sees a rope fly in between him and the newly-discovered [[Metarlos]], and hears a heart wrenching song performed on the flute. He magically parts the mists and walks out.

## Blood Spear of Kavan
[[Shalooti]] hears the whisper of a man coming from one of the cairns on the southern side of the hill. Hesitantly, she makes her way towards it, and the rest of the party except [[Anakir]] follow. At the cairn, she feels a strong beckoning from beneath it. Too famous to do it herself, she has [[Bardolf]] topple the cairn, and with all his rock experience, he does so handily. [[Bardolf]] smashes the last and biggest rock with his hammer revealing beneath it a bloody spear.

Drawn to it, but still wary, [[Shalooti]] uses her mage hand to pick up the spear and inspect it. Reasonably confident it won't hurt her, she dismisses the mage hand and wields it properly. When she touches the spear, it seems to communicate to her, and she learns that this is the +2 [[Blood Spear of Kavan]].

## Anakir Lags Behind
Not satisfied by his earlier attempts at seducing the mist, [[Anakir]] stays behind to see what else he can learn. Finally giving up, he makes his way towards the rest of the party. He looks up at the top of the hill and sees a twig blight running down the hill towards him. The rest of the party doesn't notice until [[Anakir]] absolutely obliterates the litter feller with [[Magic Missile]]. At that point, the rest of the party notices both [[Anakir]] as well as a group of multiple twig blights, needle blights, and vine blights, just like the ones from [[The Wizard of Wines (W)|The Winery]], coming down off of the hill.

## A Brotherly Spat
[[Pelanil]] takes offence to [[Anakir]]'s treatment of his little guys. Fuming, [[Pelanil]] marches over to [[Anakir]] and punches him right in the face, dealing a not-insignificant amount of damage. Triumphant, [[Pelanil]] pulls out the [[Gulthias Staff]] and uses it to direct the little guys to dance in celebration.

[[Anakir]], indignant, only escalates further. He casts fireball on the dancing little guys coming down off the hill, obliterating nearly half of their numbers.

The rest of the party watches and rolls their eyes at the quarrel. [[Elora]] hears something.

## Chanting Atop the Hill
[[Elora]] listens more closely, and can make out that the chanting is coming from on the top of the hill. She can hear multiple voices chanting "Winter. Splinter.. WINTER splinter.. WINTER SPLINTER". At first there are only 4 voices, and then another joins in, and another, and another.

[[Elora]] alerts the others as they watch the brawl. The party makes their way up the hill towards the chanting.

At the top, we can see a wide ring of black boulders and smaller rocks enclosing a field. Lightning strikes the rocks around the edge of the circle, and the group can make out a huge [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] statue made of tightly woven twigs and packed with black earth.

The group also sees the source of the chanting: a group of muddy [[Berserker]]s and [[Forest Folk]]. As they look on, even more join the fold, pushing aside rocks and rising from their earthen graves.

## The Gulthias Tree
As they top the hill, they also see a copse of dried up and dead shrubs with an enormous, misshapen tree at the center. [[Pelanil]] recognizes this tree from his dream and sees that the wood is similar to that of his staff. [[Bardolf]] notices that there is a battleaxe embedded in the tree with a humanoid skeleton below it.

[[Bardolf]] recalls his memories of trees like this, and recognizes this to be a [[Gulthias Tree Statblock|Gulthias Tree]], a plant infused with supernatural evil that originated from the original [[Gulthias Tree Statblock|Gulthias Tree]] which sprouted from the stake used to slay the vampire [[Gulthias of Nightfang Spire]].

[[Bardolf]] pulls the [[Adventurer's Battleaxe]] from the tree, intending to add a little pizazz to it later. 

![[adventurere-battleaxe.webp|200]]

[[Pelanil]] pushes his hand into the tree, and blood oozes forth. He inspects the tree and notices huge, ancient roots all around the tree. He follows the longest roots and sees that they extend all the way to the statue inside the rock circle. And in the heart of the statue, [[Pelanil]] notices the faintest glimmer of green light.

## Into Combat
[[Pelanil]] sprints towards the statue, the rest of the party not far behind. By the time he makes it there, there are 10 total [[Berserker]]s and [[Forest Folk]] joined in on the chant, their voices incredibly loud as another bolt of lightning strikes the outer edge of the circle.

Just as [[Pelanil]] makes it to the statue, a [[Berserker]] breaks away from the group and grapples him away.
