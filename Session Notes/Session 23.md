## The Mist
[[Shalooti]] pulls as hard as she can, but it's not quite enough. She slows [[Pelanil]] down, but he continues moving into the mists. [[Metarlos]] bites onto [[Elora]] butt cheeks to help pull, but [[Elora]] is caught off guard, and the bite causes her to lose her grip. [[Pelanil]] is pulled on into the mist.

## Menigal, The Departed
Finally, [[Pelanil]] can see clearly the dark figure in the mist. [[Menigal, the Departed|Menigal]] asks [[Pelanil]] why he has returned to him without completing his side of the bargain. [[Pelanil]] doesn't remember ever meeting [[Menigal, the Departed|Menigal]].

[[Menigal, the Departed]] refreshes [[Pelanil]]'s memory of their last conversation:
- He is one of the [[Dark Powers]] that coalesce in the [[Domains of Dread]]
- When the [[Shadowfell]] was created, the [[Demiplane of Dread]] fragmented
- Each Darklord's realm settled into a spot somewhere within the new plan
	- [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]]'s realm has settled here
- [[Vampyr]] is another dark power that gave [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] his immortality
- [[Menigal, the Departed|Menigal]] is tired of [[Vampyr]] getting all the souls in the valley
	- he wants [[Pelanil]]'s help collecting them
- Each [[Dark Powers|Dark Power]] likes a specific kind of soul
	- [[Vampyr]] collects those of people who died of exsanguination (blood loos)
	- [[Menigal, the Departed|Menigal]] likes souls that died of _any_ unnatural cause

[[Pelanil]] tells [[Menigal, the Departed|Menigal]] that he doesn't remember their pact ([[Pelanil's NDE]]). [[Menigal, the Departed|Menigal]] touches [[Pelanil]]'s head and bids him to remember. [[Pelanil]] does remember.

## Meanwhile
While this conversation takes no more than a couple minutes, outside the mist, much more time passes. The party waits, but there is no sign of their friend
