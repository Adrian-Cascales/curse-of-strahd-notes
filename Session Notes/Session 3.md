## Margaret the Nursemaid
The specter takes the illusion of the baby and seems appeased. She talks to the illusion as if it were, her baby son, [[Walter]].

We learn that:
- [[Gustav Durst]] wasn't there for the birth of [[Walter]] because his wife [[Elizabeth Durst]] kept him away
- After [[Walter]] was born, [[Elizabeth Durst]] became more involved in the cult and she was luring more innocent people into their basement where the screams would wake up [[Walter]]
- [[Elizabeth Durst]] and [[Gustav Durst]] would lock [[Rosevalda|Rose]] and [[Thornboldt|Thorn]] in their attic bedroom while they performed the rituals in the basement
- [[Elizabeth Durst]] took [[Walter]] from Margaret

After a minute, the illusion spell ends, the baby disappears, and so does Margaret.

## The Stairs Behind the Mirror
After Margaret vanishes, the party is left to revive [[Anakir]]. [[Pelanil]] uses some strong magic to bring [[Anakir]] nearly back to his full potential. Then, after his near death experience, as [[Anakir]] is reflecting on his life, he notices a crack in the mirror in Margaret's room. Now, terrified of the possibility of death, he quickly backs away.

[[Bardolf]] is able to make quick work of the secret door, which opens into a secret staircase leading to the attic.
