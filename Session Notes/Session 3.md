### Margaret the Nursemaid
The specter takes the illusion of the baby and seems appeased. She talks to the illusion as if it were, her baby son, [[Walter]].

We learn that:
- [[Gustav Durst]] wasn't there for the birth of [[Walter]] because his wife [[Elizabeth Durst]] kept him away
- After [[Walter]] was born, [[Elizabeth Durst]] became more involved in the cult and she was luring more innocent people into their basement where the screams would wake up [[Walter]]
- [[Elizabeth Durst]] and [[Gustav Durst]] would lock [[Rosevalda|Rose]] and [[Thornboldt|Thorn]] in their attic bedroom while they performed the rituals in the basement
- [[Elizabeth Durst]] took [[Walter]] from Margaret

After a minute, the illusion spell ends, the baby disappears, and so does Margaret.

### The Stairs Behind the Mirror
After Margaret vanishes, the party is left to revive [[Anakir]]. [[Pelanil]] uses some strong magic to bring [[Anakir]] nearly back to his full potential. Then, after his near death experience, as [[Anakir]] is reflecting on his life, he notices a crack in the mirror in Margaret's room. Now, terrified of the possibility of death, he quickly backs away.

[[Bardolf]] is able to make quick work of the secret door, which opens into a secret staircase leading to the attic.

### Finding [[Lancelot]]
Once at the top of the secret staircase, [[Shalooti]] notices pawprints in the dust on the floor. Confident this wasn't yet another wolf, she follows them into a guest bedroom. Under the bed is a terrified [[Lancelot]]. [[Shalooti]] uses her ability to communicate with animals to convince [[Lancelot]] that she and the party can be trusted. From that point forward, [[Lancelot]] cannot be separated from her.

### [[Rosevalda|Rose]] and [[Thornboldt|Thorn]]'s Room
Presented with a padlocked door, [[Pelanil]] remembers that [[Elora]] earlier found an iron key. Once she unlocks the door, the party uncovers a heartbreaking reality: [[Rosevalda|Rose]] and [[Thornboldt|Thorn]]'s skeletons are lying in the middle of the bedroom floor, apparently starved to death after being unable to escape their locked room.

[[Pelanil]], feeling sorrowful for the children, packs up their bones, intent to give them a proper burial. After filling his pack, the ghosts of the two children appear. This time, they are see-through and spectral, obviously ghosts.

Seeing that [[Pelanil]] is at a loss for words given his grief, [[Rosevalda|Rose]] speaks up to assure him that they know they're ghosts and they're actually ok with it. The party talks to the children's ghosts who explain that their parents usually locked them away when they went to the basement to deal with the monster, but that the last time, no one came back for them, no matter how much they cried.

They ask the party for help. The last time their mom went to the basement, she took their baby brother [[Walter]]. They ask the players to help save [[Walter]] and help their parents defeat the monster once and for all.

The party agrees to help. When they ask where the basement is, [[Rosevalda|Rose]] points to a dollhouse in the corner of the room. From this dollhouse, the party learns all the secrets to the house, including a secret doorway in the storage room. Before heading to the basement, the party levels up, takes a long rest, and scours the rest of the house for missed loot (they can see where it is from the replica dollhouse). Notably, [[Pelanil]] finds a very expensive-looking platinum necklace with a topaz pendant.

Rested up, the party makes their way to the storage room, the kids choosing to stay behind. [[Elora]] finds a chest with the bones of who [[Shalooti]] realizes is Margaret, the nanny. She seems to have been stabbed to death. [[Pelanil]] also scoops up these bones to take with him.

### Into the Dungeon
The party opens the secret door and descends deep into the basement. They're greeted at the bottom of the stairs by a dark, earthen corridor and an incessant chanting, that they can't seem to pinpoint.

The party discovers some empty tombs, one with [[Walter]]'s name on the door, and the other contains little coffins with their names one them.

### Cultist Quarters
The party makes their way into what seems to be a living space with a wooden table and multiple straw beds. In one of the bed alcoves, they hear something snarling. [[Pelanil]] rushes in to find out what's making the noise, and it turns out to be a ghoul which the party quickly dispatches.

Continuing to search the cultist quarters, the party each finds some treasure packed away in footlockers:
- [[Shalooti]]: 11gp, 60sp in a pouch of human skin
- [[Elora]]: 3 moss agates (10gp each)
- [[Bardolf]]: leather eyepatch with a carnelian (50gp)
- [[Pelanil]]: an ivory hairbrush with silver bristles (25gp)
- [[Anakir]]: a silvered shortsword (110gp)
	- Drawing on his experience with martial weapons, [[Bardolf]] remembers the silvered weapons have the special property of causing damage to enemies with immunity to regular weapons (e.g. werewolves)

The party hears more snarling coming from a well. Indignant, [[Bardolf]] decides to spit down the well. The ghoul at the bottom tries to shield itself as the party annihilates it.

### The Spiked Pit and the Split Party
As they ventured further into the dungeon, [[Pelanil]] observes that there is a strange place in the floor. After throwing something onto the spot, the party realizes that they've found a trap door that falls to a spiked pit. Each of the party members easily jumps the pit, except for [[Bardolf]] who is certain he can find another way around.

Separated, the main group sneaks past more snarling. Worried that [[Bardolf]] would walk directly into the beasts, [[Shalooti]] uses the new [[Sending Stones]] that [[Bardolf]] gifted her to let him know of his danger.

Still incensed at these ghouls' snarling, [[Bardolf]] first throws a rock at them in the dark, the runs headlong toward them. He finds theses beasts tucked into the earthen walls, and calls for [[Pelanil]] for backup. [[Pelanil]] strikes them with his mace which causes them to retreat into the dirt.

### The Durst's Bedroom
Back together again, the part makes their way into an underground bedroom. The first inside, [[Elora]] sees [[Gustav Durst]] hanging from the ceiling, and discovers his [[Gustav Durst's Suicide Note|suicide note]]  on the bed next to him. The note tells us that:
- [[Elizabeth Durst]] was the one who started the cult
- [[Gustav Durst]] only played along because he saw no way out

Inside the room, [[Elora]] opened a footlocker where the group found the following:
- a [[Cloak of Protection]]
- 4 [[Potion of Healing|Potions of Healing]]
- chain shirt
- mess kit
- flask of alchemist's fire
- bullseye lantern
- thieves tools

Just as [[Elora]] was pocketing the treasure, another ghoul burst from the walls. The party recognized this to be an undead [[Elizabeth Durst]], the woman from the portraits in the entryway. [[Elizabeth Durst]] curses the party, her husband, her own children, and especially Margaret and her bastard child, [[Walter]]. [[Elizabeth Durst]] invites the party to venture lower into the dungeon before [[Pelanil]], completely disgusted, strikes at the monster. The rest of the party flees, leaving [[Anakir]] and [[Pelanil]] to fight.

The two make quick work of the monster, [[Pelanil]] getting knocked unconscious just before [[Anakir]] destroys her.

### The Shrine
The party leave the Durst's bedroom and finds their way to what seems to be a shrine for a gaunt-looking man. [[Bardolf]] finds a secret set of stairs that leads upwards (presumably to the first level of the house).

[[Anakir]] takes the [[Orb of the Warmage]] from the statue, and replaces it with an equal weight, Indiana Jones style. Just as he removes the orb, multiple spirits appear and begin chanting, "Return the Orb. Begone from this place!"...
