## Margaret the Nursemaid
The specter takes the illusion of the baby and seems appeased. She talks to the illusion as if it were, her baby son [[Walter]].

We learn that:
- [[Gustav Durst]] wasn't there for the birth of [[Walter]] because his wife [[Elizabeth Durst]] kept him away
- After [[Walter]] was born, [[Elizabeth Durst]] became more involved in the cult and she was luring more innocent people into their basement where the screams would wake up [[Walter]]
- [[Elizabeth Durst]] and [[Gustav Durst]] would lock [[Rosevalda|Rose]] and [[Thornboldt|Thorn]] in their attic bed
