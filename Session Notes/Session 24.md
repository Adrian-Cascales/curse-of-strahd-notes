## Fighting the Forest Folk
The party all try their best to hack away at the statue, but every time anyone gets close, they just get grappled away by one of the [[Berserker]]s. [[Anakir]] has the best luck with casting [[Fireball]] from afar. [[Elora]] tries to distract the chanting [[Forest Folk]] with her psychic blades.

[[Elora]] evades the enemies' grapples, but [[Bardolf]], [[Pelanil]], and [[Metarlos]] do not. The group of [[Forest Folk]] continue their chant of "Winter. Splinter."

[[Bardolf]] takes a swing at the statue with his new axe, but misses completely. He trips on the [[Gulthias tree]] tree root that ran all the way to the statue. He sees the root pulse with energy just as [[Anakir]] hits the statue with another fireball.

## Wintersplinter Awakes
Suddenly, the statue explodes and from it emerges a thirty foot tall tree. [[Wintersplinter Statblock]] pulls two large leg-like roots from the ground and begins walking due north towards what the party presumes to be [[The Wizard of Wines (W)|The Winery]] while all the [[Forest Folk]] run for safety near the tree line. The ones grapping the party drop their hold and start to flee.

## Of Butt-Flutes and Crabs
Thinking on her feet, [[Shalooti]] mounts the nearby [[Metarlos]] and heads off after [[Wintersplinter Statblock]]. Just as she nears the evil tree, she stands up on [[Metarlos]], his back sturdy and his stride true. She places her flute in her butt and blasts a solitary note. A beam of magic bursts from the flute and travels directly to towards [[Wintersplinter Statblock]]. The strike lands, and a cloud of smoke erupts from the fleeing monster.

The smoke clears, and where the enormous tree once stood, now shuffles a miniscule crab holding a glowing green gem in its claws.

[[Shalooti]] scoops up the gem and rides back to the rest of the crew. She drops her focus on the [[Polymorph]] spell, and the dancing crab transforms once more into a huge tree, uprooted, and lying lifelessly on the ground. The [[Forest Folk]] seem disturbed as they disperse into the woods after seeing their deity so easily destroyed.

The party takes a second to catch their breath and decide what to do next. [[Bardolf]] hears wolves howling up the road.
